After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.  To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don&#39;t get charged for the part storage, you should call the ListParts action and ensure that the parts list is empty.

complete_multipart_upload(bucket, key, upload_id, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts. You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the ETag value, returned after that part was uploaded. Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. If you call the S3 API directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throws an exception (or, for the SDKs that don&#39;t use exceptions, they return the error).  Note that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests. For more information, see Amazon S3 Error Best Practices.  You cannot use Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded with Complete Multipart Upload requests. Also, if you do not provide a Content-Type header, CompleteMultipartUpload returns a 200 OK response.  For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload. For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions.  CompleteMultipartUpload has the following special errors:   Error code: EntityTooSmall    Description: Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum allowed object size. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part.   400 Bad Request     Error code: InvalidPart    Description: One or more of the specified parts could not be found. The part might not have been uploaded, or the specified entity tag might not have matched the part&#39;s entity tag.   400 Bad Request  Error code: InvalidPartOrder    Description: The list of parts was not in ascending order. The parts list must be specified in order by part number.   400 Bad Request     Error code: NoSuchUpload    Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist.

copy_object(bucket, key, x-amz-copy-source, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.  You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API.  All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. For more information, see REST Authentication. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. If you call the S3 API directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throws an exception (or, for the SDKs that don&#39;t use exceptions, they return the error). If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.  If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.  The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing.  Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more information, see Transfer Acceleration.   Metadata  When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see Using ACLs.  To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the x-amz-metadata-directive header. When you grant permissions, you can use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see Specifying Conditions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3.   x-amz-website-redirect-location is unique to each object and must be specified in the request headers to copy the value. x-amz-copy-source-if Headers  To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the Etag matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters:    x-amz-copy-source-if-match x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match     x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since     If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:    x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true    x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false   If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the 412 Precondition Failed response code:    x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false    x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true    All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed.   Server-side encryption  Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are copied to an S3 bucket. When copying an object, if you don&#39;t specify encryption information in your copy request, the encryption setting of the target object is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target object copy. When you perform a CopyObject operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can use other appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target object with a KMS key, an Amazon S3 managed key, or a customer-provided key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If the source object for the copy is stored in Amazon S3 using SSE-C, you must provide the necessary encryption information in your request so that Amazon S3 can decrypt the object for copying. For more information about server-side encryption, see Using Server-Side Encryption. If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API.  If the bucket that you&#39;re copying objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don&#39;t specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. For more information, see  Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.   Checksums  When copying an object, if it has a checksum, that checksum will be copied to the new object by default. When you copy the object over, you may optionally specify a different checksum algorithm to use with the x-amz-checksum-algorithm header. Storage Class Options  You can use the CopyObject action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the StorageClass parameter. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the source object&#39;s storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see RestoreObject. For more information, see Copying Objects.  Versioning  By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId subresource. If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header in the response. If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null. The following operations are related to CopyObject:    PutObject     GetObject</p><p><strong>Arguments</strong></p><ul><li><code>bucket</code>: The name of the destination bucket. When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide.</li><li><code>key</code>: The key of the destination object.</li><li><code>x-amz-copy-source</code>: Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point:   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:&amp;lt;Region&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;account-id&amp;gt;:accesspoint/&amp;lt;access-point-name&amp;gt;/object/&amp;l t;key&amp;gt;. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded.  Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:&amp;lt;Region&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;account-id&amp;gt;:outpost/&amp;lt;outpost-id&amp;gt;/object/&amp;lt ;key&amp;gt;. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.    To copy a specific version of an object, append ?versionId=&amp;lt;version-id&amp;gt; to the value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893). If you don&#39;t specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Parameters</strong></p><p>Optional parameters can be passed as a <code>params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any}</code>.

create_bucket(bucket, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Bucket naming rules. If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see Create Bucket.  By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see Accessing a bucket.  If you send your create bucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets.   Access control lists (ACLs)  When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally configure the bucket ACL to specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket.  If your CreateBucket request sets bucket owner enforced for S3 Object Ownership and specifies a bucket ACL that provides access to an external Amazon Web Services account, your request fails with a 400 error and returns the InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership error code. For more information, see Controlling object ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.   Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access control list (ACL) overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id â if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account uri â if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress â if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland) South America (SÃ£o Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata: x-amz-grant-read: id=&quot;11112222333&quot;, id=&quot;444455556666&quot;      You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.   Permissions  In addition to s3:CreateBucket, the following permissions are required when your CreateBucket includes specific headers:    ACLs - If your CreateBucket request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl permissions are needed. If the ACL the CreateBucket request is private or doesn&#39;t specify any ACLs, only s3:CreateBucket permission is needed.

create_multipart_upload(bucket, key, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see UploadPart). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview. If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions. For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4).  After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.   Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don&#39;t specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a KMS key, an Amazon S3 managed key, or a customer-provided key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in UploadPart and UploadPartCopy requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload. You can request that Amazon S3 save the uploaded parts encrypted with server-side encryption with an Amazon S3 managed key (SSE-S3), an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C).  To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions and Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.  For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption.  Access Permissions  When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview.   You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers  Amazon S3 encrypts data by using server-side encryption with an Amazon S3 managed key (SSE-S3) by default. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can request that Amazon S3 encrypts data at rest by using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption keys (SSE-C). Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3) and KMS customer managed keys stored in Key Management Service (KMS) â If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.    x-amz-server-side-encryption     x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id  x-amz-server-side-encryption-context     If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don&#39;t provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3 key) in KMS to protect the data.   All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by KMS fail if you don&#39;t make them by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Signature Version 4.  For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys.   Use customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) â If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request. x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information about server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), see  Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C).    Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  You also can use the following access controlârelated headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see Using ACLs. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:   Specify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl) â Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly â To explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:    x-amz-grant-read     x-amz-grant-write     x-amz-grant-read-acp     x-amz-grant-write-acp     x-amz-grant-full-control    You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id â if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account uri â if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress â if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland) South America (SÃ£o Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata: x-amz-grant-read: id=&quot;11112222333&quot;, id=&quot;444455556666&quot;       The following operations are related to CreateMultipartUpload:    UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload AbortMultipartUpload     ListParts     ListMultipartUploads</p><p><strong>Arguments</strong></p><ul><li><code>bucket</code>: The name of the bucket to which to initiate the upload When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname.

delete_objects(bucket, delete, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead. The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.  The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body. When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see  MFA Delete. Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

To ensure that bucket owners don&#39;t inadvertently lock themselves out of their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner&#39;s Amazon Web Services account can perform the GetBucketPolicy, PutBucketPolicy, and DeleteBucketPolicy API actions, even if their bucket policy explicitly denies the root principal&#39;s access. Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from performing these API actions by VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web Services Organizations policies.  To use this API operation against an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name. To use this API operation against an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned.

get_object(bucket, key, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use GET, you must have READ access to the object. If you grant READ access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header. An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object sample.jpg, you can name it photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the GET operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the resource as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the resource as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification. For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see GetObjectAcl. If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject. Otherwise, this action returns an InvalidObjectState error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects. Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3âmanaged encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, youâll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers: x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5   For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys). Assuming you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the response also returns the x-amz-tagging-count header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.  Permissions  You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 (&quot;no such key&quot;) error.   If you donât have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 (&quot;access denied&quot;) error.    Versioning  By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the versionId subresource.     If you supply a versionId, you need the s3:GetObjectVersion permission to access a specific version of an object. If you request a specific version, you do not need to have the s3:GetObject permission. If you request the current version without a specific version ID, only s3:GetObject permission is required. s3:GetObjectVersion permission won&#39;t be required.   If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.    For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning.   Overriding Response Header Values  There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request. You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are Content-Type, Content-Language, Expires, Cache-Control, Content-Disposition, and Content-Encoding. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.  You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.     response-content-type response-content-language     response-expires     response-cache-control response-content-disposition     response-content-encoding     Overriding Response Header Values  If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates to true, and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.  If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-None-Match condition evaluates to false, and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

This action is useful if you&#39;re interested only in an object&#39;s metadata. To use GetObjectAttributes, you must have READ access to the object.  GetObjectAttributes combines the functionality of HeadObject and ListParts. All of the data returned with each of those individual calls can be returned with a single call to GetObjectAttributes. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers:    x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Encryption request headers, such as x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you&#39;ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error.    The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the object. Consider the following when using request headers:    If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code 200 OK and the data requested:    If-Match condition evaluates to true.    If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false.     If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code 304 Not Modified:    If-None-Match condition evaluates to false. If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true.     For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.  Permissions  The permissions that you need to use this operation depend on whether the bucket is versioned. If the bucket is versioned, you need both the s3:GetObjectVersion and s3:GetObjectVersionAttributes permissions for this operation. If the bucket is not versioned, you need the s3:GetObject and s3:GetObjectAttributes permissions. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the object that you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found (&quot;no such key&quot;) error.

head_object(bucket, key, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This action is useful if you&#39;re only interested in an object&#39;s metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the object. A HEAD request has the same options as a GET action on an object. The response is identical to the GET response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the HEAD request generates an error, it returns a generic 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found code. It is not possible to retrieve the exact exception beyond these error codes. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers:   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys).    Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3âmanaged encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, youâll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.    The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the object.    Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see Common Request Headers. Consider the following when using request headers:    Consideration 1 â If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows:    If-Match condition evaluates to true, and;    If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false;   Then Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.    Consideration 2 â If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-None-Match condition evaluates to false, and;    If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true;   Then Amazon S3 returns the 304 Not Modified response code.   For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.  Permissions  You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 (&quot;no such key&quot;) error.   If you donât have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 (&quot;access denied&quot;) error.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. For more information, see Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects.

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to Amazon S3.  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources. The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the following two values:   Enabled â Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.    Suspended â Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.   The GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration action returns the transfer acceleration state of a bucket. After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it might take up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the bucket increase.  The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and must not contain periods (&quot;.&quot;).  For more information about transfer acceleration, see Transfer Acceleration.

To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have WRITE_ACP permission. You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket&#39;s permissions: Specify the ACL in the request body   Specify permissions using request headers    You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.  Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.  If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the AccessControlListNotSupported error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see Controlling object ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Permissions  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id â if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account    uri â if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress â if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (SÃ£o Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-write: uri=&quot;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery&quot;, id=&quot;111122223333&quot;, id=&quot;555566667777&quot;     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you&#39;re assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person&#39;s ID:  &amp;lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:type=&quot;CanonicalUser&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ID&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;ID&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ID&amp;gt;&amp;lt;DisplayName&amp;gt;&amp;lt ;&amp;gt;GranteesEmail&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/DisplayName&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/Grantee&amp;gt;  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request   By URI:  &amp;lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:type=&quot;Group&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;URI&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/Authenticate dUsers&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/URI&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Grantee&amp;gt;    By Email address:  &amp;lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:type=&quot;AmazonCustomerByEmail&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;EmailAddress&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;Grantees@email.com&amp;lt;&amp;gt ;&amp;lt;/EmailAddress&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&amp;lt;/Grantee&amp;gt;  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the s3:PutBucketCORS action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others. You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is http://www.example.com to access your Amazon S3 bucket at my.example.bucket.com by using the browser&#39;s XMLHttpRequest capability. To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the cors subresource to the bucket. The cors subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.  When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the cors configuration on the bucket and uses the first CORSRule rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:   The request&#39;s Origin header must match AllowedOrigin elements.   The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the Access-Control-Request-Method header in case of a pre-flight OPTIONS request must be one of the AllowedMethod elements.

Keep in mind that this will overwrite an existing lifecycle configuration, so if you want to retain any configuration details, they must be included in the new lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see Managing your storage lifecycle.  Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility. For the related API description, see PutBucketLifecycle.   Rules You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. An Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration can have up to 1,000 rules. This limit is not adjustable. Each rule consists of the following:   Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination of both.   Status whether the rule is in effect.   One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and noncurrent object versions.   For more information, see Object Lifecycle Management and Lifecycle Configuration Elements. Permissions  By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services account that created it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration permission.

For more information about event notifications, see Configuring Event Notifications. Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the specified type. By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification configuration will be an empty NotificationConfiguration. &amp;lt;NotificationConfiguration&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;/NotificationConfiguration&amp;gt;  This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you include in the request body. After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events. You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element. For more information about the number of event notification configurations that you can create per bucket, see Amazon S3 service quotas in Amazon Web Services General Reference. By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with s3:PutBucketNotification permission.  The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.  If the configuration in the request body includes only one TopicConfiguration specifying only the s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event type, the response will also include the x-amz-sns-test-message-id header containing the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

In the replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information. A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset. To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and Priority.  If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see Backward Compatibility.  For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Using Versioning.  Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects  By default, Amazon S3 doesn&#39;t replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: SourceSelectionCriteria, SseKmsEncryptedObjects, Status, EncryptionConfiguration, and ReplicaKmsKeyID. For information about replication configuration, see Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys. For information on PutBucketReplication errors, see List of replication-related error codes   Permissions  To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have s3:PutReplicationConfiguration permissions for the bucket.  By default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket, can perform this operation.

put_object(bucket, key, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.  Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. You cannot use PutObject to only update a single piece of metadata for an existing object. You must put the entire object with updated metadata if you want to update some values.  Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. To prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten, you can use Amazon S3 Object Lock. To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.    To successfully complete the PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObject in your IAM permissions.   To successfully change the objects acl of your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectAcl in your IAM permissions.   To successfully set the tag-set with your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectTagging in your IAM permissions.    The Content-MD5 header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     You have three mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at by rest using server-side encryption with other key options. For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption. When adding a new object, you can use headers to grant ACL-based permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API.  If the bucket that you&#39;re uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don&#39;t specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a 400 error with the error code AccessControlListNotSupported. For more information, see  Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.  By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects. For more information about versioning, see Adding Objects to Versioning-Enabled Buckets. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning.

In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket: x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html  In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website:  x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/  For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 and How to Configure Website Page Redirects.</li></ul></div><a class="docs-sourcelink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JuliaCloud/AWS.jl/blob/ed9a9ea434c62cb57804e16da1fbc3895e4d3785/src/services/s3.jl#L5558-L5742">source</a></section></article><article class="docstring"><header><a class="docstring-binding" id="Main.S3.put_object_acl-Tuple{Any, Any}" href="#Main.S3.put_object_acl-Tuple{Any, Any}"><code>Main.S3.put_object_acl</code></a> â <span class="docstring-category">Method</span></header><section><div><pre><code class="language-julia">put_object_acl(bucket, key)
put_object_acl(bucket, key, params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any})</code></pre><p>Uses the acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see What permissions can I grant? in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts. Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the AccessControlListNotSupported error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see Controlling object ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id â if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account uri â if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress â if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland) South America (SÃ£o Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress=&quot;xyz@amazon.com&quot;, emailAddress=&quot;abc@amazon.com&quot;     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you&#39;re assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person&#39;s ID:  &amp;lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:type=&quot;CanonicalUser&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ID&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;ID&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ID&amp;gt;&amp;lt;DisplayName&amp;gt;&amp;lt ;&amp;gt;GranteesEmail&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/DisplayName&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/Grantee&amp;gt;  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.   By URI:  &amp;lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:type=&quot;Group&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;URI&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/Authenticate dUsers&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/URI&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Grantee&amp;gt;    By Email address:  &amp;lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:type=&quot;AmazonCustomerByEmail&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;EmailAddress&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;Grantees@email.com&amp;lt;&amp;gt ;&amp;lt;/EmailAddress&amp;gt;lt;/Grantee&amp;gt;  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland) South America (SÃ£o Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. Versioning  The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object.

This action performs the following types of requests:     select - Perform a select query on an archived object    restore an archive - Restore an archived object   For more information about the S3 structure in the request body, see the following:    PutObject     Managing Access with ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide    Define the SQL expression for the SELECT type of restoration for your query in the request body&#39;s SelectParameters structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.   The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  SELECT * FROM Object  Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.  SELECT s.<em>1, s.</em>2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &amp;gt; 100    If you have headers and you set the fileHeaderInfo in the CSV structure in the request body to USE, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the fileHeaderInfo field to IGNORE, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s    When making a select request, you can also do the following:   To expedite your queries, specify the Expedited tier. For more information about tiers, see &quot;Restoring Archives,&quot; later in this topic. Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.   The following are additional important facts about the select feature:   The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle configuration.   You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn&#39;t duplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.    Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesnât return error response 409.    Permissions  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:RestoreObject action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Restoring objects  Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don&#39;t provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version. When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:     Expedited - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1â5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.    Standard - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3â5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.    Bulk - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5â12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.    For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  To get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon S3 User Guide. After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object. If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide.  Responses  A successful action returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status code.    If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns 202 Accepted in the response.    If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the response.      Special errors:    Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress     Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

In the request, along with the SQL expression, you must also specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data serialization format for the response. This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts. For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see Selecting Content from Objects and SELECT Command in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions  You must have s3:GetObject permission for this operation.Â Amazon S3 Select does not support anonymous access. For more information about permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Object Data Formats  You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following format properties:    CSV, JSON, and Parquet - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format. UTF-8 - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.    GZIP or BZIP2 - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.    Server-side encryption - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects that are protected with server-side encryption. For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are documented in the GetObject. For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) and Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don&#39;t need to specify anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Working with the Response Body  Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a series of messages and includes a Transfer-Encoding header with chunked as its value in the response. For more information, see Appendix: SelectObjectContent Response.  GetObject Support  The SelectObjectContent action does not support the following GetObject functionality. For more information, see GetObject.    Range: Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3 Select request (see SelectObjectContentRequest - ScanRange in the request parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of an object to return.    GLACIER, DEEP<em>ARCHIVE and REDUCED</em>REDUNDANCY storage classes: You cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP<em>ARCHIVE, or REDUCED</em>REDUNDANCY storage classes.

However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.   You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see Multipart upload limits in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.  If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum instead of Content-MD5. For more information see Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4).   Note: After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage. For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide . For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have three mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C). If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload. For more information, go to Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don&#39;t need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see CreateMultipartUpload. If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers. x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    UploadPart has the following special errors:      Code: NoSuchUpload     Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.

Consideration 2 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request as follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false, and;  x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true; Amazon S3 returns 412 Precondition Failed response code.     Versioning  If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don&#39;t specify a versionId in the x-amz-copy-source, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the x-amz-copy-source and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the x-amz-copy-source.  You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the versionId subresource as shown in the following example:  x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id   Special errors       Code: NoSuchUpload     Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.     HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found        Code: InvalidRequest     Cause: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range copy source.     HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request        The following operations are related to UploadPartCopy:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart CompleteMultipartUpload     AbortMultipartUpload     ListParts     ListMultipartUploads</p><p><strong>Arguments</strong></p><ul><li><code>bucket</code>: The bucket name. When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form  AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide.</li><li><code>key</code>: Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.</li><li><code>part_number</code>: Part number of part being copied. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.</li><li><code>upload_id</code>: Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being copied.</li><li><code>x-amz-copy-source</code>: Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point:   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:&amp;lt;Region&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;account-id&amp;gt;:accesspoint/&amp;lt;access-point-name&amp;gt;/object/&amp;l t;key&amp;gt;. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded.  Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:&amp;lt;Region&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;account-id&amp;gt;:outpost/&amp;lt;outpost-id&amp;gt;/object/&amp;lt ;key&amp;gt;. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.    To copy a specific version of an object, append ?versionId=&amp;lt;version-id&amp;gt; to the value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893). If you don&#39;t specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Parameters</strong></p><p>Optional parameters can be passed as a <code>params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any}</code>. Valid keys are:</p><ul><li><code>&quot;x-amz-copy-source-if-match&quot;</code>: Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since&quot;</code>: Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match&quot;</code>: Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since&quot;</code>: Copies the object if it hasn&#39;t been modified since the specified time.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-copy-source-range&quot;</code>: The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm&quot;</code>: Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for example, AES256).</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key&quot;</code>: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object. The encryption key provided in this header must be one that was used when the source object was created.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5&quot;</code>: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-expected-bucket-owner&quot;</code>: The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the destination bucket is owned by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-request-payer&quot;</code>:</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm&quot;</code>: Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key&quot;</code>: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header. This must be the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload request.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5&quot;</code>: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.</li><li><code>&quot;x-amz-source-expected-bucket-owner&quot;</code>: The account ID of the expected source bucket owner.

For information about Object Lambda access points, see Transforming objects with Object Lambda access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This operation supports metadata that can be returned by GetObject, in addition to RequestRoute, RequestToken, StatusCode, ErrorCode, and ErrorMessage. The GetObject response metadata is supported so that the WriteGetObjectResponse caller, typically an Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it internally invokes GetObject. When WriteGetObjectResponse is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the end user GetObject call might differ from what Amazon S3 would normally return. You can include any number of metadata headers. When including a metadata header, it should be prefaced with x-amz-meta. For example, x-amz-meta-my-custom-header: MyCustomValue. The primary use case for this is to forward GetObject metadata. Amazon Web Services provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Repository, and can be selected through the Amazon Web Services Management Console when you create your Object Lambda access point. Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.  Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.  Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.  For information on how to view and use these functions, see Using Amazon Web Services built Lambda functions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.</p><p><strong>Arguments</strong></p><ul><li><code>x-amz-request-route</code>: Route prefix to the HTTP URL generated.</li><li><code>x-amz-request-token</code>: A single use encrypted token that maps WriteGetObjectResponse to the end user GetObject request.</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Parameters</strong></p><p>Optional parameters can be passed as a <code>params::Dict{String,&lt;:Any}</code>.
