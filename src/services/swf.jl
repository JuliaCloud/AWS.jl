    CountClosedWorkflowExecutions()

Returns the number of closed workflow executions within the given domain that meet the specified filtering criteria.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.   Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:   Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.   Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to call this action.   Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element with the appropriate keys.    tagFilter.tag: String constraint. The key is swf:tagFilter.tag.    typeFilter.name: String constraint. The key is swf:typeFilter.name.    typeFilter.version: String constraint. The key is swf:typeFilter.version.     If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `domain`: The name of the domain containing the workflow executions to count.

# Optional Parameters
- `closeStatusFilter`: If specified, only workflow executions that match this close status are counted. This filter has an affect only if executionStatus is specified as CLOSED.   closeStatusFilter, executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request. 
- `closeTimeFilter`: If specified, only workflow executions that meet the close time criteria of the filter are counted.   startTimeFilter and closeTimeFilter are mutually exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not both. 
- `executionFilter`: If specified, only workflow executions matching the WorkflowId in the filter are counted.   closeStatusFilter, executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request. 
- `startTimeFilter`: If specified, only workflow executions that meet the start time criteria of the filter are counted.   startTimeFilter and closeTimeFilter are mutually exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not both. 
- `tagFilter`: If specified, only executions that have a tag that matches the filter are counted.   closeStatusFilter, executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request. 
- `typeFilter`: If specified, indicates the type of the workflow executions to be counted.   closeStatusFilter, executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

    ListOpenWorkflowExecutions()

Returns a list of open workflow executions in the specified domain that meet the filtering criteria. The results may be split into multiple pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make the call again using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.   Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:   Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.

Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element with the appropriate keys.    tagFilter.tag: String constraint. The key is swf:tagFilter.tag.    typeFilter.name: String constraint. The key is swf:typeFilter.name.    typeFilter.version: String constraint. The key is swf:typeFilter.version.     If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `domain`: The name of the domain that contains the workflow executions to list.
- `startTimeFilter`: Workflow executions are included in the returned results based on whether their start times are within the range specified by this filter.

# Optional Parameters
- `executionFilter`: If specified, only workflow executions matching the workflow ID specified in the filter are returned.   executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request. 
- `maximumPageSize`: The maximum number of results that are returned per call. Use nextPageToken to obtain further pages of results. 
- `nextPageToken`: If NextPageToken is returned there are more results available. The value of NextPageToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 60 seconds. Using an expired pagination token will return a 400 error: \"Specified token has exceeded its maximum lifetime\".  The configured maximumPageSize determines how many results can be returned in a single call. 
- `reverseOrder`: When set to true, returns the results in reverse order. By default the results are returned in descending order of the start time of the executions.

    PollForActivityTask()

Used by workers to get an ActivityTask from the specified activity taskList. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available. The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns an empty result. An empty result, in this context, means that an ActivityTask is returned, but that the value of taskToken is an empty string.

    PollForDecisionTask()

Used by deciders to get a DecisionTask from the specified decision taskList. A decision task may be returned for any open workflow execution that is using the specified task list. The task includes a paginated view of the history of the workflow execution. The decider should use the workflow type and the history to determine how to properly handle the task. This action initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon a task becomes available. If no decision task is available in the specified task list before the timeout of 60 seconds expires, an empty result is returned. An empty result, in this context, means that a DecisionTask is returned, but that the value of taskToken is an empty string.  Deciders should set their client side socket timeout to at least 70 seconds (10 seconds higher than the timeout).   Because the number of workflow history events for a single workflow execution might be very large, the result returned might be split up across a number of pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make additional calls to PollForDecisionTask using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call. Note that you do not call GetWorkflowExecutionHistory with this nextPageToken. Instead, call PollForDecisionTask again.   Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:   Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.   Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to call this action.   Constrain the taskList.name parameter by using a Condition element with the swf:taskList.name key to allow the action to access only certain task lists.

# Optional Parameters
- `identity`: Identity of the decider making the request, which is recorded in the DecisionTaskStarted event in the workflow history. This enables diagnostic tracing when problems arise. The form of this identity is user defined.
- `maximumPageSize`: The maximum number of results that are returned per call. Use nextPageToken to obtain further pages of results.  This is an upper limit only; the actual number of results returned per call may be fewer than the specified maximum.

    RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat()

Used by activity workers to report to the service that the ActivityTask represented by the specified taskToken is still making progress. The worker can also specify details of the progress, for example percent complete, using the details parameter. This action can also be used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested for the activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for the specified task, then the boolean cancelRequested flag returned by the service is set to true. This action resets the taskHeartbeatTimeout clock. The taskHeartbeatTimeout is specified in RegisterActivityType. This action doesn't in itself create an event in the workflow execution history. However, if the task times out, the workflow execution history contains a ActivityTaskTimedOut event that contains the information from the last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.  The taskStartToCloseTimeout of an activity type is the maximum duration of an activity task, regardless of the number of RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat requests received. The taskStartToCloseTimeout is also specified in RegisterActivityType.   This operation is only useful for long-lived activities to report liveliness of the task and to determine if a cancellation is being attempted.   If the cancelRequested flag returns true, a cancellation is being attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it should respond with RespondActivityTaskCanceled. Otherwise, it should ignore the cancellation request.   Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:   Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.

Also, it must not be the literal string arn.

# Optional Parameters
- `defaultTaskHeartbeatTimeout`: If set, specifies the default maximum time before which a worker processing a task of this type must report progress by calling RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat. If the timeout is exceeded, the activity task is automatically timed out. This default can be overridden when scheduling an activity task using the ScheduleActivityTask Decision. If the activity worker subsequently attempts to record a heartbeat or returns a result, the activity worker receives an UnknownResource fault. In this case, Amazon SWF no longer considers the activity task to be valid; the activity worker should clean up the activity task. The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to 0. You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.
- `defaultTaskList`: If set, specifies the default task list to use for scheduling tasks of this activity type. This default task list is used if a task list isn't provided when a task is scheduled through the ScheduleActivityTask Decision.
- `defaultTaskPriority`: The default task priority to assign to the activity type. If not assigned, then 0 is used. Valid values are integers that range from Java's Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

# Optional Parameters
- `defaultChildPolicy`: If set, specifies the default policy to use for the child workflow executions when a workflow execution of this type is terminated, by calling the TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWorkflowExecution Decision. The supported child policies are:    TERMINATE – The child executions are terminated.    REQUEST_CANCEL – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.    ABANDON – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.  
- `defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout`: If set, specifies the default maximum duration for executions of this workflow type. You can override this default when starting an execution through the StartWorkflowExecution Action or StartChildWorkflowExecution Decision. The duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to 0. Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of \"NONE\" for defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout; there is a one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run. Exceeding this limit always causes the workflow execution to time out.
- `defaultLambdaRole`: The default IAM role attached to this workflow type.  Executions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda functions. If you don't specify an IAM role when you start this workflow type, the default Lambda role is attached to the execution. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide. 
- `defaultTaskList`: If set, specifies the default task list to use for scheduling decision tasks for executions of this workflow type. This default is used only if a task list isn't provided when starting the execution through the StartWorkflowExecution Action or StartChildWorkflowExecution Decision.
- `defaultTaskPriority`: The default task priority to assign to the workflow type. If not assigned, then 0 is used. Valid values are integers that range from Java's Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority. For more information about setting task priority, see Setting Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.
- `defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout`: If set, specifies the default maximum duration of decision tasks for this workflow type. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWorkflowExecution Decision. The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to 0. You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

    StartWorkflowExecution()

Starts an execution of the workflow type in the specified domain using the provided workflowId and input data. This action returns the newly started workflow execution.

Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to call this action.   Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element with the appropriate keys.    tagList.member.0: The key is swf:tagList.member.0.    tagList.member.1: The key is swf:tagList.member.1.    tagList.member.2: The key is swf:tagList.member.2.    tagList.member.3: The key is swf:tagList.member.3.    tagList.member.4: The key is swf:tagList.member.4.    taskList: String constraint. The key is swf:taskList.name.    workflowType.name: String constraint. The key is swf:workflowType.name.    workflowType.version: String constraint. The key is swf:workflowType.version.     If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `domain`: The name of the domain in which the workflow execution is created.
- `workflowId`: The user defined identifier associated with the workflow execution. You can use this to associate a custom identifier with the workflow execution. You may specify the same identifier if a workflow execution is logically a restart of a previous execution. You cannot have two open workflow executions with the same workflowId at the same time within the same domain. The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control characters (u0000-u001f | u007f-u009f). Also, it must not be the literal string arn.
- `workflowType`: The type of the workflow to start.

# Optional Parameters
- `childPolicy`: If set, specifies the policy to use for the child workflow executions of this workflow execution if it is terminated, by calling the TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This policy overrides the default child policy specified when registering the workflow type using RegisterWorkflowType. The supported child policies are:    TERMINATE – The child executions are terminated.    REQUEST_CANCEL – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.    ABANDON – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.    A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified at registration time then a fault is returned. 
- `executionStartToCloseTimeout`: The total duration for this workflow execution. This overrides the defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout specified when registering the workflow type. The duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to 0. Exceeding this limit causes the workflow execution to time out. Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of \"NONE\" for this timeout; there is a one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run.  An execution start-to-close timeout must be specified either through this parameter or as a default when the workflow type is registered. If neither this parameter nor a default execution start-to-close timeout is specified, a fault is returned. 
- `input`: The input for the workflow execution. This is a free form string which should be meaningful to the workflow you are starting. This input is made available to the new workflow execution in the WorkflowExecutionStarted history event.
- `lambdaRole`: The IAM role to attach to this workflow execution.  Executions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda functions. If you don't attach an IAM role, any attempt to schedule a Lambda task fails. This results in a ScheduleLambdaFunctionFailed history event. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide. 
- `tagList`: The list of tags to associate with the workflow execution. You can specify a maximum of 5 tags. You can list workflow executions with a specific tag by calling ListOpenWorkflowExecutions or ListClosedWorkflowExecutions and specifying a TagFilter.
- `taskList`: The task list to use for the decision tasks generated for this workflow execution. This overrides the defaultTaskList specified when registering the workflow type.  A task list for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default task list was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.  The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control characters (u0000-u001f | u007f-u009f). Also, it must not be the literal string arn.
- `taskPriority`: The task priority to use for this workflow execution. This overrides any default priority that was assigned when the workflow type was registered. If not set, then the default task priority for the workflow type is used. Valid values are integers that range from Java's Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority. For more information about setting task priority, see Setting Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.
- `taskStartToCloseTimeout`: Specifies the maximum duration of decision tasks for this workflow execution. This parameter overrides the defaultTaskStartToCloseTimout specified when registering the workflow type using RegisterWorkflowType. The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to 0. You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.  A task start-to-close timeout for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default task start-to-close timeout was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.

    TerminateWorkflowExecution()

Records a WorkflowExecutionTerminated event and forces closure of the workflow execution identified by the given domain, runId, and workflowId.
