    count_closed_workflow_executions(domain)
    count_closed_workflow_executions(domain, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Returns the number of closed workflow executions within the given domain that meet the
specified filtering criteria.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are
best effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.   Access Control  You
can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
 Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to call this action.   Constrain the
following parameters by using a Condition element with the appropriate keys.
tagFilter.tag: String constraint. The key is swf:tagFilter.tag.    typeFilter.name: String
constraint. The key is swf:typeFilter.name.    typeFilter.version: String constraint. The
key is swf:typeFilter.version.     If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to
invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the
action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage
Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `domain`: The name of the domain containing the workflow executions to count.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"closeStatusFilter"`: If specified, only workflow executions that match this close
  status are counted. This filter has an affect only if executionStatus is specified as
  CLOSED.   closeStatusFilter, executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually
  exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.
- `"closeTimeFilter"`: If specified, only workflow executions that meet the close time
  criteria of the filter are counted.   startTimeFilter and closeTimeFilter are mutually
  exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not both.
- `"executionFilter"`: If specified, only workflow executions matching the WorkflowId in
  the filter are counted.   closeStatusFilter, executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are
  mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.
- `"startTimeFilter"`: If specified, only workflow executions that meet the start time
  criteria of the filter are counted.   startTimeFilter and closeTimeFilter are mutually
  exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not both.
- `"tagFilter"`: If specified, only executions that have a tag that matches the filter are
  counted.   closeStatusFilter, executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually
  exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.
- `"typeFilter"`: If specified, indicates the type of the workflow executions to be
  counted.   closeStatusFilter, executionFilter, typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually
  exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

Used by workers to get an ActivityTask from the specified activity taskList. This initiates
a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a
task becomes available. The maximum time the service holds on to the request before
responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns an
empty result. An empty result, in this context, means that an ActivityTask is returned, but
that the value of taskToken is an empty string. If a task is returned, the worker should

Used by deciders to get a DecisionTask from the specified decision taskList. A decision
task may be returned for any open workflow execution that is using the specified task list.
The task includes a paginated view of the history of the workflow execution. The decider
should use the workflow type and the history to determine how to properly handle the task.
This action initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and
responds as soon a task becomes available. If no decision task is available in the
specified task list before the timeout of 60 seconds expires, an empty result is returned.
An empty result, in this context, means that a DecisionTask is returned, but that the value
of taskToken is an empty string.  Deciders should set their client side socket timeout to
at least 70 seconds (10 seconds higher than the timeout).   Because the number of workflow
history events for a single workflow execution might be very large, the result returned
might be split up across a number of pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make additional
calls to PollForDecisionTask using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call. Note
that you do not call GetWorkflowExecutionHistory with this nextPageToken. Instead, call
PollForDecisionTask again.   Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this

    record_activity_task_heartbeat(task_token)
    record_activity_task_heartbeat(task_token, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Used by activity workers to report to the service that the ActivityTask represented by the
specified taskToken is still making progress. The worker can also specify details of the
progress, for example percent complete, using the details parameter. This action can also
be used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested for the
activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for the specified task, then the
boolean cancelRequested flag returned by the service is set to true. This action resets the
taskHeartbeatTimeout clock. The taskHeartbeatTimeout is specified in RegisterActivityType.
This action doesn't in itself create an event in the workflow execution history. However,
if the task times out, the workflow execution history contains a ActivityTaskTimedOut event
that contains the information from the last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.
The taskStartToCloseTimeout of an activity type is the maximum duration of an activity
task, regardless of the number of RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat requests received. The
taskStartToCloseTimeout is also specified in RegisterActivityType.   This operation is only
useful for long-lived activities to report liveliness of the task and to determine if a
cancellation is being attempted.   If the cancelRequested flag returns true, a cancellation
is being attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it should respond with
RespondActivityTaskCanceled. Otherwise, it should ignore the cancellation request.   Access

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"defaultTaskHeartbeatTimeout"`: If set, specifies the default maximum time before which
  a worker processing a task of this type must report progress by calling
  RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat. If the timeout is exceeded, the activity task is automatically
  timed out. This default can be overridden when scheduling an activity task using the
  ScheduleActivityTask Decision. If the activity worker subsequently attempts to record a
  heartbeat or returns a result, the activity worker receives an UnknownResource fault. In
  this case, Amazon SWF no longer considers the activity task to be valid; the activity
  worker should clean up the activity task. The duration is specified in seconds, an integer
  greater than or equal to 0. You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.
- `"defaultTaskList"`: If set, specifies the default task list to use for scheduling tasks
  of this activity type. This default task list is used if a task list isn't provided when a
  task is scheduled through the ScheduleActivityTask Decision.
- `"defaultTaskPriority"`: The default task priority to assign to the activity type. If not
  assigned, then 0 is used. Valid values are integers that range from Java's
  Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate
  higher priority. For more information about setting task priority, see Setting Task
  Priority in the in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide..
- `"defaultTaskScheduleToCloseTimeout"`: If set, specifies the default maximum duration for
  a task of this activity type. This default can be overridden when scheduling an activity
  task using the ScheduleActivityTask Decision. The duration is specified in seconds, an
  integer greater than or equal to 0. You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.
- `"defaultTaskScheduleToStartTimeout"`: If set, specifies the default maximum duration
  that a task of this activity type can wait before being assigned to a worker. This default

  whitespace. It must not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control
  characters (u0000-u001f | u007f-u009f). Also, it must not be the literal string arn.
- `version`: The version of the workflow type.  The workflow type consists of the name and
  version, the combination of which must be unique within the domain. To get a list of all
  currently registered workflow types, use the ListWorkflowTypes action.  The specified
  string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not contain a : (colon), / (slash), |
  (vertical bar), or any control characters (u0000-u001f | u007f-u009f). Also, it must not be
  the literal string arn.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"defaultChildPolicy"`: If set, specifies the default policy to use for the child
  workflow executions when a workflow execution of this type is terminated, by calling the
  TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This default can
  be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or
  the StartChildWorkflowExecution Decision. The supported child policies are:    TERMINATE
  – The child executions are terminated.    REQUEST_CANCEL – A request to cancel is
  attempted for each child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in
  its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an
  execution history with this event.    ABANDON – No action is taken. The child executions
  continue to run.
- `"defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout"`: If set, specifies the default maximum duration
  for executions of this workflow type. You can override this default when starting an
  execution through the StartWorkflowExecution Action or StartChildWorkflowExecution
  Decision. The duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to 0.
  Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of
  \"NONE\" for defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout; there is a one-year max limit on the time
  that a workflow execution can run. Exceeding this limit always causes the workflow
  execution to time out.
- `"defaultLambdaRole"`: The default IAM role attached to this workflow type.  Executions
  of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda functions. If you don't specify an
  IAM role when you start this workflow type, the default Lambda role is attached to the
  execution. For more information, see
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html in the Amazon
  SWF Developer Guide.
- `"defaultTaskList"`: If set, specifies the default task list to use for scheduling
  decision tasks for executions of this workflow type. This default is used only if a task
  list isn't provided when starting the execution through the StartWorkflowExecution Action
  or StartChildWorkflowExecution Decision.
- `"defaultTaskPriority"`: The default task priority to assign to the workflow type. If not
  assigned, then 0 is used. Valid values are integers that range from Java's
  Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate
  higher priority. For more information about setting task priority, see Setting Task
  Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.
- `"defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout"`: If set, specifies the default maximum duration of
  decision tasks for this workflow type. This default can be overridden when starting a
  workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the
  StartChildWorkflowExecution Decision. The duration is specified in seconds, an integer
  greater than or equal to 0. You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.
- `"description"`: Textual description of the workflow type.

# Arguments
- `domain`: The name of the domain in which the workflow execution is created.
- `workflow_id`: The user defined identifier associated with the workflow execution. You
  can use this to associate a custom identifier with the workflow execution. You may specify
  the same identifier if a workflow execution is logically a restart of a previous execution.

- `workflow_type`: The type of the workflow to start.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"childPolicy"`: If set, specifies the policy to use for the child workflow executions of
  this workflow execution if it is terminated, by calling the TerminateWorkflowExecution
  action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This policy overrides the default child
  policy specified when registering the workflow type using RegisterWorkflowType. The
  supported child policies are:    TERMINATE – The child executions are terminated.
  REQUEST_CANCEL – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a
  WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in its history. It is up to the decider to take
  appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.    ABANDON –
  No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.    A child policy for this
  workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through
  this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified
  at registration time then a fault is returned.
- `"executionStartToCloseTimeout"`: The total duration for this workflow execution. This
  overrides the defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout specified when registering the workflow
  type. The duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to 0.
  Exceeding this limit causes the workflow execution to time out. Unlike some of the other
  timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of \"NONE\" for this timeout;
  there is a one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run.  An execution
  start-to-close timeout must be specified either through this parameter or as a default when
  the workflow type is registered. If neither this parameter nor a default execution
  start-to-close timeout is specified, a fault is returned.
- `"input"`: The input for the workflow execution. This is a free form string which should
  be meaningful to the workflow you are starting. This input is made available to the new
  workflow execution in the WorkflowExecutionStarted history event.
- `"lambdaRole"`: The IAM role to attach to this workflow execution.  Executions of this
  workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda functions. If you don't attach an IAM role,
  any attempt to schedule a Lambda task fails. This results in a ScheduleLambdaFunctionFailed
  history event. For more information, see
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html in the Amazon
  SWF Developer Guide.
- `"tagList"`: The list of tags to associate with the workflow execution. You can specify a
  maximum of 5 tags. You can list workflow executions with a specific tag by calling
  ListOpenWorkflowExecutions or ListClosedWorkflowExecutions and specifying a TagFilter.
- `"taskList"`: The task list to use for the decision tasks generated for this workflow
  execution. This overrides the defaultTaskList specified when registering the workflow type.
   A task list for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the
  workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default
  task list was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.  The specified
  string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not contain a : (colon), / (slash), |
  (vertical bar), or any control characters (u0000-u001f | u007f-u009f). Also, it must not be
  the literal string arn.
- `"taskPriority"`: The task priority to use for this workflow execution. This overrides
  any default priority that was assigned when the workflow type was registered. If not set,
  then the default task priority for the workflow type is used. Valid values are integers
  that range from Java's Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647).
  Higher numbers indicate higher priority. For more information about setting task priority,
  see Setting Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.
- `"taskStartToCloseTimeout"`: Specifies the maximum duration of decision tasks for this
  workflow execution. This parameter overrides the defaultTaskStartToCloseTimout specified
  when registering the workflow type using RegisterWorkflowType. The duration is specified in
  seconds, an integer greater than or equal to 0. You can use NONE to specify unlimited
  duration.  A task start-to-close timeout for this workflow execution must be specified

Undeprecates a previously deprecated domain. After a domain has been undeprecated it can be
used to create new workflow executions or register new types.  This operation is eventually
consistent. The results are best effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and
changes.   Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to
Amazon SWF resources as follows:   Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the
action to only specified domains.   Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to
call this action.   You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.
If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter
values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event
attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM
