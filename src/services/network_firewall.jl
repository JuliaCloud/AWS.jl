    associate_firewall_policy(firewall_policy_arn)
    associate_firewall_policy(firewall_policy_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Associates a FirewallPolicy to a Firewall.  A firewall policy defines how to monitor and
manage your VPC network traffic, using a collection of inspection rule groups and other
settings. Each firewall requires one firewall policy association, and you can use the same
firewall policy for multiple firewalls.

# Arguments
- `firewall_policy_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"FirewallArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall. You must specify the ARN
  or the name, and you can specify both.
- `"FirewallName"`: The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
  firewall after you create it. You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify
  both.
- `"UpdateToken"`: An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network
  Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the
  state of the firewall resource at the time of the request.  To make an unconditional change
  to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall
  performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last
  retrieved it. To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your
  update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed
  since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an
  InvalidTokenException. If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy
  of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using
  the new token.

    associate_subnets(subnet_mappings)
    associate_subnets(subnet_mappings, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Associates the specified subnets in the Amazon VPC to the firewall. You can specify one
subnet for each of the Availability Zones that the VPC spans.  This request creates an
Network Firewall firewall endpoint in each of the subnets. To enable the firewall's
protections, you must also modify the VPC's route tables for each subnet's Availability
Zone, to redirect the traffic that's coming into and going out of the zone through the
firewall endpoint.

# Arguments
- `subnet_mappings`: The IDs of the subnets that you want to associate with the firewall.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"FirewallArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall. You must specify the ARN
  or the name, and you can specify both.

    create_firewall(firewall_name, firewall_policy_arn, subnet_mappings, vpc_id)
    create_firewall(firewall_name, firewall_policy_arn, subnet_mappings, vpc_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Network Firewall Firewall and accompanying FirewallStatus for a VPC.  The
firewall defines the configuration settings for an Network Firewall firewall. The settings
that you can define at creation include the firewall policy, the subnets in your VPC to use
for the firewall endpoints, and any tags that are attached to the firewall Amazon Web
Services resource.  After you create a firewall, you can provide additional settings, like
the logging configuration.  To update the settings for a firewall, you use the operations
that apply to the settings themselves, for example UpdateLoggingConfiguration,
AssociateSubnets, and UpdateFirewallDeleteProtection.  To manage a firewall's tags, use the
standard Amazon Web Services resource tagging operations, ListTagsForResource, TagResource,
and UntagResource. To retrieve information about firewalls, use ListFirewalls and
DescribeFirewall.

# Arguments
- `firewall_name`: The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
  firewall after you create it.
- `firewall_policy_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FirewallPolicy that you want
  to use for the firewall.
- `subnet_mappings`: The public subnets to use for your Network Firewall firewalls. Each
  subnet must belong to a different Availability Zone in the VPC. Network Firewall creates a
  firewall endpoint in each subnet.
- `vpc_id`: The unique identifier of the VPC where Network Firewall should create the
  firewall.  You can't change this setting after you create the firewall.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DeleteProtection"`: A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A
  setting of TRUE indicates that the firewall is protected against deletion. Use this setting
  to protect against accidentally deleting a firewall that is in use. When you create a
  firewall, the operation initializes this flag to TRUE.
- `"Description"`: A description of the firewall.
- `"EncryptionConfiguration"`: A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your
  firewall resources.
- `"FirewallPolicyChangeProtection"`: A setting indicating whether the firewall is
  protected against a change to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to protect
  against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a firewall that is in use. When you
  create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to TRUE.
- `"SubnetChangeProtection"`: A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected
  against changes to the subnet associations. Use this setting to protect against
  accidentally modifying the subnet associations for a firewall that is in use. When you
  create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to TRUE.
- `"Tags"`: The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

"""
    create_rule_group(capacity, rule_group_name, type)
    create_rule_group(capacity, rule_group_name, type, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates the specified stateless or stateful rule group, which includes the rules for
network traffic inspection, a capacity setting, and tags.  You provide your rule group
specification in your request using either RuleGroup or Rules.

# Arguments
- `capacity`: The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group
  capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to this
  capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves
  this capacity for the rule group.  You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for
  a rule group before you create the rule group by calling CreateRuleGroup with DryRun set to
  TRUE.   You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update the rule group, so leave
  room for your rule group to grow.    Capacity for a stateless rule group  For a stateless
  rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual
  rules that you expect to have in the rule group.  To calculate the capacity requirement of
  a single rule, multiply the capacity requirement values of each of the rule's match
  settings:   A match setting with no criteria specified has a value of 1.    A match setting
  with Any specified has a value of 1.    All other match settings have a value equal to the
  number of elements provided in the setting. For example, a protocol setting [\"UDP\"] and a
  source setting [\"10.0.0.0/24\"] each have a value of 1. A protocol setting
  [\"UDP\",\"TCP\"] has a value of 2. A source setting
  [\"10.0.0.0/24\",\"10.0.0.1/24\",\"10.0.0.2/24\"] has a value of 3.    A rule with no
  criteria specified in any of its match settings has a capacity requirement of 1. A rule
  with protocol setting [\"UDP\",\"TCP\"], source setting
  [\"10.0.0.0/24\",\"10.0.0.1/24\",\"10.0.0.2/24\"], and a single specification or no
  specification for each of the other match settings has a capacity requirement of 6.
  Capacity for a stateful rule group  For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity
  required is the number of individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.
- `rule_group_name`: The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a
  rule group after you create it.
- `type`: Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is
  stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: A description of the rule group.
- `"DryRun"`: Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the

  sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and that your request
  parameters are valid.  If set to FALSE, Network Firewall makes the requested changes to
  your resources.
- `"EncryptionConfiguration"`: A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your
  rule group resources.
- `"RuleGroup"`: An object that defines the rule group rules.   You must provide either
  this rule group setting or a Rules setting, but not both.
- `"Rules"`: A string containing stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata flat
  format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing Suricata compatible rule
  groups.   You must provide either this rules setting or a populated RuleGroup setting, but
  not both.   You can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat format through
  this setting when you create or update your rule group. The call response returns a
  RuleGroup object that Network Firewall has populated from your string.
- `"SourceMetadata"`: A complex type that contains metadata about the rule group that your
  own rule group is copied from. You can use the metadata to keep track of updates made to
  the originating rule group.
- `"Tags"`: The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

    update_firewall_policy(firewall_policy, update_token)
    update_firewall_policy(firewall_policy, update_token, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates the properties of the specified firewall policy.

# Arguments
- `firewall_policy`: The updated firewall policy to use for the firewall.
- `update_token`: A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to
  your requests that access the firewall policy. The token marks the state of the policy
  resource at the time of the request.  To make changes to the policy, you provide the token
  in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the policy hasn't changed
  since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an
  InvalidTokenException. If this happens, retrieve the firewall policy again to get a current
  copy of it with current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again
  using the new token.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: A description of the firewall policy.
- `"DryRun"`: Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the
  request, rather than run the request.  If set to TRUE, Network Firewall checks whether the
  request can run successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call
  returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry run set to FALSE,
  but doesn't make additions or changes to your resources. This option allows you to make
  sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and that your request
  parameters are valid.  If set to FALSE, Network Firewall makes the requested changes to
  your resources.
- `"EncryptionConfiguration"`: A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your
  firewall policy resources.
- `"FirewallPolicyArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy. You must
  specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
- `"FirewallPolicyName"`: The descriptive name of the firewall policy. You can't change the
  name of a firewall policy after you create it. You must specify the ARN or the name, and
  you can specify both.

    update_firewall_policy_change_protection(firewall_policy_change_protection)
    update_firewall_policy_change_protection(firewall_policy_change_protection, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Modifies the flag, ChangeProtection, which indicates whether it is possible to change the
firewall. If the flag is set to TRUE, the firewall is protected from changes. This setting
helps protect against accidentally changing a firewall that's in use.

# Arguments
- `firewall_policy_change_protection`: A setting indicating whether the firewall is
  protected against a change to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to protect
  against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a firewall that is in use. When you
  create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to TRUE.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"FirewallArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall. You must specify the ARN
  or the name, and you can specify both.
- `"FirewallName"`: The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
  firewall after you create it. You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify
  both.
- `"UpdateToken"`: An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network
  Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token marks the
  state of the firewall resource at the time of the request.  To make an unconditional change
  to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall
  performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last
  retrieved it. To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your
  update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed
  since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an
  InvalidTokenException. If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy
  of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using

    update_logging_configuration()
    update_logging_configuration(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Sets the logging configuration for the specified firewall.  To change the logging
configuration, retrieve the LoggingConfiguration by calling DescribeLoggingConfiguration,
then change it and provide the modified object to this update call. You must change the
logging configuration one LogDestinationConfig at a time inside the retrieved
LoggingConfiguration object.  You can perform only one of the following actions in any call
to UpdateLoggingConfiguration:    Create a new log destination object by adding a single
LogDestinationConfig array element to LogDestinationConfigs.   Delete a log destination
object by removing a single LogDestinationConfig array element from LogDestinationConfigs.
 Change the LogDestination setting in a single LogDestinationConfig array element.   You
can't change the LogDestinationType or LogType in a LogDestinationConfig. To change these
settings, delete the existing LogDestinationConfig object and create a new one, using two
separate calls to this update operation.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"FirewallArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall. You must specify the ARN
  or the name, and you can specify both.
- `"FirewallName"`: The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
  firewall after you create it. You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify
  both.
- `"LoggingConfiguration"`: Defines how Network Firewall performs logging for a firewall.

    update_rule_group(update_token)
    update_rule_group(update_token, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates the rule settings for the specified rule group. You use a rule group by reference
in one or more firewall policies. When you modify a rule group, you modify all firewall
policies that use the rule group.  To update a rule group, first call DescribeRuleGroup to
retrieve the current RuleGroup object, update the object as needed, and then provide the
updated object to this call.

# Arguments
- `update_token`: A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to
  your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of the rule group
  resource at the time of the request.  To make changes to the rule group, you provide the
  token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group hasn't

- `"EncryptionConfiguration"`: A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your
  rule group resources.
- `"RuleGroup"`: An object that defines the rule group rules.   You must provide either
  this rule group setting or a Rules setting, but not both.
- `"RuleGroupArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group. You must specify the
  ARN or the name, and you can specify both.
- `"RuleGroupName"`: The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a
  rule group after you create it. You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify
  both.
- `"Rules"`: A string containing stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata flat
  format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing Suricata compatible rule
  groups.   You must provide either this rules setting or a populated RuleGroup setting, but
  not both.   You can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat format through
  this setting when you create or update your rule group. The call response returns a
  RuleGroup object that Network Firewall has populated from your string.
- `"SourceMetadata"`: A complex type that contains metadata about the rule group that your
  own rule group is copied from. You can use the metadata to keep track of updates made to
  the originating rule group.
- `"Type"`: Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is
  stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules.
  This setting is required for requests that do not include the RuleGroupARN.
