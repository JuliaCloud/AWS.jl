    CreateMember()

Creates a member within a Managed Blockchain network.

Required Parameters
ClientRequestToken => A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the operation. An idempotent operation completes no more than one time.

InvitationId => The unique identifier of the invitation that is sent to the member to join the network.
MemberConfiguration => Member configuration parameters.
networkId => The unique identifier of the network in which the member is created.
