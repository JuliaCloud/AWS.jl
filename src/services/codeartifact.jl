    AssociateExternalConnection()

Adds an existing external connection to a repository. One external connection is allowed per repository.  A repository can have one or more upstream repositories, or an external connection. 

# Required Parameters
- `domain`: The name of the domain that contains the repository.
- `external-connection`:  The name of the external connection to add to the repository. The following values are supported:     public:npmjs - for the npm public repository.     public:pypi - for the Python Package Index.     public:maven-central - for Maven Central.     public:maven-googleandroid - for the Google Android repository.     public:maven-gradleplugins - for the Gradle plugins repository.     public:maven-commonsware - for the CommonsWare Android repository.   
- `repository`:  The name of the repository to which the external connection is added. 

# Optional Parameters
- `domain-owner`:  The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

"""
    CopyPackageVersions()

 Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain.    You must specify versions or versionRevisions. You cannot specify both.  

# Required Parameters
- `destination-repository`:  The name of the repository into which package versions are copied. 
- `domain`:  The name of the domain that contains the source and destination repositories. 
- `format`:  The format of the package that is copied. The valid package types are:     npm: A Node Package Manager (npm) package.     pypi: A Python Package Index (PyPI) package.     maven: A Maven package that contains compiled code in a distributable format, such as a JAR file.   
- `package`:  The name of the package that is copied. 
- `source-repository`:  The name of the repository that contains the package versions to copy. 

# Optional Parameters
- `allowOverwrite`:  Set to true to overwrite a package version that already exists in the destination repository. If set to false and the package version already exists in the destination repository, the package version is returned in the failedVersions field of the response with an ALREADY_EXISTS error code. 
- `domain-owner`:  The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces. 
- `includeFromUpstream`:  Set to true to copy packages from repositories that are upstream from the source repository to the destination repository. The default setting is false. For more information, see Working with upstream repositories. 
- `namespace`:  The namespace of the package. The package component that specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:     The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId.     The namespace of an npm package is its scope.     A Python package does not contain a corresponding component, so Python packages do not have a namespace.   
- `versionRevisions`:  A list of key-value pairs. The keys are package versions and the values are package version revisions. A CopyPackageVersion operation succeeds if the specified versions in the source repository match the specified package version revision.    You must specify versions or versionRevisions. You cannot specify both.  
- `versions`:  The versions of the package to copy.    You must specify versions or versionRevisions. You cannot specify both.

"""
    CreateDomain()

 Creates a domain. CodeArtifact domains make it easier to manage multiple repositories across an organization. You can use a domain to apply permissions across many repositories owned by different AWS accounts. An asset is stored only once in a domain, even if it's in multiple repositories.  Although you can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that your development teams can find and share packages. You can use a second pre-production domain to test changes to the production domain configuration. 

# Required Parameters
- `domain`:  The name of the domain to create. All domain names in an AWS Region that are in the same AWS account must be unique. The domain name is used as the prefix in DNS hostnames. Do not use sensitive information in a domain name because it is publicly discoverable. 

# Optional Parameters
- `encryptionKey`:  The encryption key for the domain. This is used to encrypt content stored in a domain. An encryption key can be a key ID, a key Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a key alias, or a key alias ARN. To specify an encryptionKey, your IAM role must have kms:DescribeKey and kms:CreateGrant permissions on the encryption key that is used. For more information, see DescribeKey in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference and AWS KMS API Permissions Reference in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.    CodeArtifact supports only symmetric CMKs. Do not associate an asymmetric CMK with your domain. For more information, see Using symmetric and asymmetric keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    GetAuthorizationToken()

 Generates a temporary authentication token for accessing repositories in the domain. This API requires the codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken and sts:GetServiceBearerToken permissions.   CodeArtifact authorization tokens are valid for a period of 12 hours when created with the login command. You can call login periodically to refresh the token. When you create an authorization token with the GetAuthorizationToken API, you can set a custom authorization period, up to a maximum of 12 hours, with the durationSeconds parameter. The authorization period begins after login or GetAuthorizationToken is called. If login or GetAuthorizationToken is called while assuming a role, the token lifetime is independent of the maximum session duration of the role. For example, if you call sts assume-role and specify a session duration of 15 minutes, then generate a CodeArtifact authorization token, the token will be valid for the full authorization period even though this is longer than the 15-minute session duration. See Using IAM Roles for more information on controlling session duration.  

# Required Parameters
- `domain`:  The name of the domain that is in scope for the generated authorization token.

- `domain-owner`:  The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces. 
- `namespace`:  The namespace of the package. The package component that specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:     The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId.     The namespace of an npm package is its scope.     A Python package does not contain a corresponding component, so Python packages do not have a namespace.
