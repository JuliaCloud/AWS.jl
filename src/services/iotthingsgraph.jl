    AssociateEntityToThing()

Associates a device with a concrete thing that is in the user's registry. A thing can be associated with only one device at a time. If you associate a thing with a new device id, its previous association will be removed.

Required Parameters
{
  "entityId": "The ID of the device to be associated with the thing. The ID should be in the following format.  urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:device:DEVICENAME ",
  "thingName": "The name of the thing to which the entity is to be associated."

    CreateFlowTemplate()

Creates a workflow template. Workflows can be created only in the user's namespace. (The public namespace contains only entities.) The workflow can contain only entities in the specified namespace. The workflow is validated against the entities in the latest version of the user's namespace unless another namespace version is specified in the request.

Required Parameters

    CreateSystemInstance()

Creates a system instance.  This action validates the system instance, prepares the deployment-related resources. For Greengrass deployments, it updates the Greengrass group that is specified by the greengrassGroupName parameter. It also adds a file to the S3 bucket specified by the s3BucketName parameter. You need to call DeploySystemInstance after running this action. For Greengrass deployments, since this action modifies and adds resources to a Greengrass group and an S3 bucket on the caller's behalf, the calling identity must have write permissions to both the specified Greengrass group and S3 bucket. Otherwise, the call will fail with an authorization error. For cloud deployments, this action requires a flowActionsRoleArn value. This is an IAM role that has permissions to access AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and AWS IoT, that the flow uses when it executes. If the definition document doesn't specify a version of the user's namespace, the latest version will be used by default.

Required Parameters
{
  "definition": "",
  "target": "The target type of the deployment. Valid values are GREENGRASS and CLOUD."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "flowActionsRoleArn": "The ARN of the IAM role that AWS IoT Things Graph will assume when it executes the flow. This role must have read and write access to AWS Lambda and AWS IoT and any other AWS services that the flow uses when it executes. This value is required if the value of the target parameter is CLOUD.",

    UploadEntityDefinitions()

Asynchronously uploads one or more entity definitions to the user's namespace. The document parameter is required if syncWithPublicNamespace and deleteExistingEntites are false.

If deprecateExistingEntities is set to true, all entities in the latest version will be deleted before the new DefinitionDocument is uploaded. When a user uploads entity definitions for the first time, the service creates a new namespace for the user. The new namespace tracks the public namespace. Currently users can have only one namespace. The namespace version increments whenever a user uploads entity definitions that are backwards-incompatible and whenever a user sets the syncWithPublicNamespace parameter or the deprecateExistingEntities parameter to true.
