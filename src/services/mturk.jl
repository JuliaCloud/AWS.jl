    accept_qualification_request(qualification_request_id)
    accept_qualification_request(qualification_request_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 The AcceptQualificationRequest operation approves a Worker's request for a Qualification.
 Only the owner of the Qualification type can grant a Qualification request for that type.
 A successful request for the AcceptQualificationRequest operation returns with no errors
and an empty body.

# Arguments
- `qualification_request_id`: The ID of the Qualification request, as returned by the
  GetQualificationRequests operation.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"IntegerValue"`:  The value of the Qualification. You can omit this value if you are
  using the presence or absence of the Qualification as the basis for a HIT requirement.

    approve_assignment(assignment_id)
    approve_assignment(assignment_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 The ApproveAssignment operation approves the results of a completed assignment.
Approving an assignment initiates two payments from the Requester's Amazon.com account
The Worker who submitted the results is paid the reward specified in the HIT.     Amazon
Mechanical Turk fees are debited.     If the Requester's account does not have adequate
funds for these payments, the call to ApproveAssignment returns an exception, and the
approval is not processed. You can include an optional feedback message with the approval,
which the Worker can see in the Status section of the web site.   You can also call this
operation for assignments that were previous rejected and approve them by explicitly
overriding the previous rejection. This only works on rejected assignments that were
submitted within the previous 30 days and only if the assignment's related HIT has not been
deleted.

# Arguments
- `assignment_id`:  The ID of the assignment. The assignment must correspond to a HIT
  created by the Requester.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"OverrideRejection"`:  A flag indicating that an assignment should be approved even if
  it was previously rejected. Defaults to False.
- `"RequesterFeedback"`:  A message for the Worker, which the Worker can see in the Status
  section of the web site.

    associate_qualification_with_worker(qualification_type_id, worker_id)
    associate_qualification_with_worker(qualification_type_id, worker_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 The AssociateQualificationWithWorker operation gives a Worker a Qualification.
AssociateQualificationWithWorker does not require that the Worker submit a Qualification
request. It gives the Qualification directly to the Worker.   You can only assign a
Qualification of a Qualification type that you created (using the CreateQualificationType
operation).    Note: AssociateQualificationWithWorker does not affect any pending
Qualification requests for the Qualification by the Worker. If you assign a Qualification
to a Worker, then later grant a Qualification request made by the Worker, the granting of
the request may modify the Qualification score. To resolve a pending Qualification request
without affecting the Qualification the Worker already has, reject the request with the
RejectQualificationRequest operation.

# Arguments
- `qualification_type_id`: The ID of the Qualification type to use for the assigned
  Qualification.
- `worker_id`:  The ID of the Worker to whom the Qualification is being assigned. Worker
  IDs are included with submitted HIT assignments and Qualification requests.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"IntegerValue"`: The value of the Qualification to assign.
- `"SendNotification"`:  Specifies whether to send a notification email message to the
  Worker saying that the qualification was assigned to the Worker. Note: this is true by
  default.

    create_additional_assignments_for_hit(hitid, number_of_additional_assignments)
    create_additional_assignments_for_hit(hitid, number_of_additional_assignments, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 The CreateAdditionalAssignmentsForHIT operation increases the maximum number of
assignments of an existing HIT.   To extend the maximum number of assignments, specify the
number of additional assignments.    HITs created with fewer than 10 assignments cannot be
extended to have 10 or more assignments. Attempting to add assignments in a way that brings
the total number of assignments for a HIT from fewer than 10 assignments to 10 or more
assignments will result in an AWS.MechanicalTurk.InvalidMaximumAssignmentsIncrease
exception.   HITs that were created before July 22, 2015 cannot be extended. Attempting to
extend HITs that were created before July 22, 2015 will result in an
AWS.MechanicalTurk.HITTooOldForExtension exception.

# Arguments
- `hitid`: The ID of the HIT to extend.
- `number_of_additional_assignments`: The number of additional assignments to request for
  this HIT.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"UniqueRequestToken"`:  A unique identifier for this request, which allows you to retry
  the call on error without extending the HIT multiple times. This is useful in cases such as
  network timeouts where it is unclear whether or not the call succeeded on the server. If
  the extend HIT already exists in the system from a previous call using the same
  UniqueRequestToken, subsequent calls will return an error with a message containing the
  request ID.

    create_hit(assignment_duration_in_seconds, description, lifetime_in_seconds, reward, title, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The CreateHIT operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT). The new HIT is made
available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website.   This
operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties of the
HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass these values
to CreateHIT, a new HIT is created for you, with a new HITTypeID. The HITTypeID can be used
to create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common parameters such
as the title, description and reward amount each time.  An alternative way to create HITs
is to first generate a HITTypeID using the CreateHITType operation and then call the
CreateHITWithHITType operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who
are creating large numbers of HITs.  CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide
question data: by providing a value for the Question parameter that fully specifies the
contents of the HIT, or by providing a HitLayoutId and associated HitLayoutParameters.
If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For
more information, see Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing.

# Arguments
- `assignment_duration_in_seconds`:  The amount of time, in seconds, that a Worker has to
  complete the HIT after accepting it. If a Worker does not complete the assignment within
  the specified duration, the assignment is considered abandoned. If the HIT is still active
  (that is, its lifetime has not elapsed), the assignment becomes available for other users
  to find and accept.
- `description`:  A general description of the HIT. A description includes detailed
  information about the kind of task the HIT contains. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk web
  site, the HIT description appears in the expanded view of search results, and in the HIT
  and assignment screens. A good description gives the user enough information to evaluate
  the HIT before accepting it.
- `lifetime_in_seconds`:  An amount of time, in seconds, after which the HIT is no longer
  available for users to accept. After the lifetime of the HIT elapses, the HIT no longer
  appears in HIT searches, even if not all of the assignments for the HIT have been accepted.
- `reward`:  The amount of money the Requester will pay a Worker for successfully
  completing the HIT.
- `title`:  The title of the HIT. A title should be short and descriptive about the kind of
  task the HIT contains. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, the HIT title appears in
  search results, and everywhere the HIT is mentioned.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AssignmentReviewPolicy"`:  The Assignment-level Review Policy applies to the
  assignments under the HIT. You can specify for Mechanical Turk to take various actions
  based on the policy.
- `"AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds"`:  The number of seconds after an assignment for the HIT
  has been submitted, after which the assignment is considered Approved automatically unless
  the Requester explicitly rejects it.
- `"HITLayoutId"`:  The HITLayoutId allows you to use a pre-existing HIT design with
  placeholder values and create an additional HIT by providing those values as
  HITLayoutParameters.   Constraints: Either a Question parameter or a HITLayoutId parameter
  must be provided.
- `"HITLayoutParameters"`:  If the HITLayoutId is provided, any placeholder values must be
  filled in with values using the HITLayoutParameter structure. For more information, see
  HITLayout.
- `"HITReviewPolicy"`:  The HIT-level Review Policy applies to the HIT. You can specify for
  Mechanical Turk to take various actions based on the policy.
- `"Keywords"`:  One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by commas.
  These words are used in searches to find HITs.
- `"MaxAssignments"`:  The number of times the HIT can be accepted and completed before the
  HIT becomes unavailable.
- `"QualificationRequirements"`:  Conditions that a Worker's Qualifications must meet in
  order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements.
  All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other
  actions can be restricted using the ActionsGuarded field on each QualificationRequirement
  structure.
- `"Question"`:  The data the person completing the HIT uses to produce the results.
  Constraints: Must be a QuestionForm data structure, an ExternalQuestion data structure, or
  an HTMLQuestion data structure. The XML question data must not be larger than 64 kilobytes
  (65,535 bytes) in size, including whitespace.  Either a Question parameter or a HITLayoutId
  parameter must be provided.
- `"RequesterAnnotation"`:  An arbitrary data field. The RequesterAnnotation parameter lets
  your application attach arbitrary data to the HIT for tracking purposes. For example, this
  parameter could be an identifier internal to the Requester's application that corresponds
  with the HIT.   The RequesterAnnotation parameter for a HIT is only visible to the
  Requester who created the HIT. It is not shown to the Worker, or any other Requester.   The
  RequesterAnnotation parameter may be different for each HIT you submit. It does not affect
  how your HITs are grouped.
- `"UniqueRequestToken"`:  A unique identifier for this request which allows you to retry
  the call on error without creating duplicate HITs. This is useful in cases such as network
  timeouts where it is unclear whether or not the call succeeded on the server. If the HIT
  already exists in the system from a previous call using the same UniqueRequestToken,
  subsequent calls will return a AWS.MechanicalTurk.HitAlreadyExists error with a message
  containing the HITId.    Note: It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the token.
  The unique token expires after 24 hours. Subsequent calls using the same UniqueRequestToken
  made after the 24 hour limit could create duplicate HITs.

    update_notification_settings(hittype_id)
    update_notification_settings(hittype_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 The UpdateNotificationSettings operation creates, updates, disables or re-enables
notifications for a HIT type. If you call the UpdateNotificationSettings operation for a
HIT type that already has a notification specification, the operation replaces the old
specification with a new one. You can call the UpdateNotificationSettings operation to
enable or disable notifications for the HIT type, without having to modify the notification
specification itself by providing updates to the Active status without specifying a new
notification specification. To change the Active status of a HIT type's notifications, the
HIT type must already have a notification specification, or one must be provided in the
same call to UpdateNotificationSettings.

# Arguments
- `hittype_id`:  The ID of the HIT type whose notification specification is being updated.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Active"`:  Specifies whether notifications are sent for HITs of this HIT type,
  according to the notification specification. You must specify either the Notification
  parameter or the Active parameter for the call to UpdateNotificationSettings to succeed.
- `"Notification"`:  The notification specification for the HIT type.

    update_qualification_type(qualification_type_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 The UpdateQualificationType operation modifies the attributes of an existing Qualification
type, which is represented by a QualificationType data structure. Only the owner of a
Qualification type can modify its attributes.   Most attributes of a Qualification type can
be changed after the type has been created. However, the Name and Keywords fields cannot be
modified. The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be modified or added to change the delay or
to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot be used to disable retries.   You can use
this operation to update the test for a Qualification type. The test is updated based on
the values specified for the Test, TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All
three parameters specify the updated test. If you are updating the test for a type, you
must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The AnswerKey parameter is
optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does not have an answer key.   If you
omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type is unchanged. There is no way
to remove a test from a Qualification type that has one. If the type already has a test,
you cannot update it to be AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and
one is provided by an update, the type will henceforth have a test.   If you want to update
the test duration or answer key for an existing test without changing the questions, you
must specify a Test parameter with the original questions, along with the updated values.
If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not have an answer key.
Requests for such Qualifications must be granted manually.   You can also update the
AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue attributes of the Qualification type.

# Arguments
- `qualification_type_id`: The ID of the Qualification type to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AnswerKey"`: The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test parameter, in
  the form of an AnswerKey data structure.
- `"AutoGranted"`: Specifies whether requests for the Qualification type are granted
  immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test. Constraints: If the
  Test parameter is specified, this parameter cannot be true.
- `"AutoGrantedValue"`: The Qualification value to use for automatically granted
  Qualifications. This parameter is used only if the AutoGranted parameter is true.
- `"Description"`: The new description of the Qualification type.
- `"QualificationTypeStatus"`: The new status of the Qualification type - Active | Inactive
- `"RetryDelayInSeconds"`: The amount of time, in seconds, that Workers must wait after
  requesting a Qualification of the specified Qualification type before they can retry the
  Qualification request. It is not possible to disable retries for a Qualification type after
  it has been created with retries enabled. If you want to disable retries, you must dispose
  of the existing retry-enabled Qualification type using DisposeQualificationType and then
  create a new Qualification type with retries disabled using CreateQualificationType.
- `"Test"`: The questions for the Qualification test a Worker must answer correctly to
  obtain a Qualification of this type. If this parameter is specified, TestDurationInSeconds
  must also be specified. Constraints: Must not be longer than 65535 bytes. Must be a
  QuestionForm data structure. This parameter cannot be specified if AutoGranted is true.
  Constraints: None. If not specified, the Worker may request the Qualification without
  answering any questions.
- `"TestDurationInSeconds"`: The number of seconds the Worker has to complete the
  Qualification test, starting from the time the Worker requests the Qualification.
