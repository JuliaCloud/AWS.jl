    get_compliance_summary()
    get_compliance_summary(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Returns a table that shows counts of resources that are noncompliant with their tag
policies. For more information on tag policies, see Tag Policies in the AWS Organizations
User Guide.  You can call this operation only from the organization's management account
and from the us-east-1 Region. This operation supports pagination, where the response can
be sent in multiple pages. You should check the PaginationToken response parameter to
determine if there are additional results available to return. Repeat the query, passing
the PaginationToken response parameter value as an input to the next request until you
recieve a null value. A null value for PaginationToken indicates that there are no more
results waiting to be returned.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"GroupBy"`: Specifies a list of attributes to group the counts of noncompliant resources
  by. If supplied, the counts are sorted by those attributes.
- `"MaxResults"`: Specifies the maximum number of results to be returned in each page. A
  query can return fewer than this maximum, even if there are more results still to return.
  You should always check the PaginationToken response value to see if there are more
  results. You can specify a minimum of 1 and a maximum value of 100.
- `"PaginationToken"`: Specifies a PaginationToken response value from a previous request
  to indicate that you want the next page of results. Leave this parameter empty in your
  initial request.
- `"RegionFilters"`: Specifies a list of AWS Regions to limit the output by. If you use
  this parameter, the count of returned noncompliant resources includes only resources in the
  specified Regions.
- `"ResourceTypeFilters"`: Specifies that you want the response to include information for
  only resources of the specified types. The format of each resource type is
  service[:resourceType]. For example, specifying a resource type of ec2 returns all Amazon
  EC2 resources (which includes EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type of ec2:instance
  returns only EC2 instances.  The string for each service name and resource type is the same
  as that embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Consult the AWS General
  Reference for the following:   For a list of service name strings, see AWS Service
  Namespaces.   For resource type strings, see Example ARNs.   For more information about
  ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces.   You can specify
  multiple resource types by using a comma separated array. The array can include up to 100
  items. Note that the length constraint requirement applies to each resource type filter.
- `"TagKeyFilters"`: Specifies that you want the response to include information for only
  resources that have tags with the specified tag keys. If you use this parameter, the count
  of returned noncompliant resources includes only resources that have the specified tag keys.
- `"TargetIdFilters"`: Specifies target identifiers (usually, specific account IDs) to
  limit the output by. If you use this parameter, the count of returned noncompliant
  resources includes only resources with the specified target IDs.

    get_resources()
    get_resources(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Returns all the tagged or previously tagged resources that are located in the specified
Region for the AWS account. Depending on what information you want returned, you can also
specify the following:    Filters that specify what tags and resource types you want
returned. The response includes all tags that are associated with the requested resources.
 Information about compliance with the account's effective tag policy. For more information
on tag policies, see Tag Policies in the AWS Organizations User Guide.    This operation
supports pagination, where the response can be sent in multiple pages. You should check the
PaginationToken response parameter to determine if there are additional results available
to return. Repeat the query, passing the PaginationToken response parameter value as an
input to the next request until you recieve a null value. A null value for PaginationToken
indicates that there are no more results waiting to be returned.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ExcludeCompliantResources"`: Specifies whether to exclude resources that are compliant
  with the tag policy. Set this to true if you are interested in retrieving information on
  noncompliant resources only. You can use this parameter only if the
  IncludeComplianceDetails parameter is also set to true.
- `"IncludeComplianceDetails"`: Specifies whether to include details regarding the
  compliance with the effective tag policy. Set this to true to determine whether resources
  are compliant with the tag policy and to get details.
- `"PaginationToken"`: Specifies a PaginationToken response value from a previous request
  to indicate that you want the next page of results. Leave this parameter empty in your
  initial request.
- `"ResourceARNList"`: Specifies a list of ARNs of resources for which you want to retrieve
  tag data. You can't specify both this parameter and any of the pagination parameters
  (ResourcesPerPage, TagsPerPage, PaginationToken) in the same request. If you specify both,
  you get an Invalid Parameter exception. If a resource specified by this parameter doesn't
  exist, it doesn't generate an error; it simply isn't included in the response. An ARN
  (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource. For more information, see Amazon
  Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces in the AWS General Reference.
- `"ResourceTypeFilters"`: Specifies the resource types that you want included in the
  response. The format of each resource type is service[:resourceType]. For example,
  specifying a resource type of ec2 returns all Amazon EC2 resources (which includes EC2
  instances). Specifying a resource type of ec2:instance returns only EC2 instances.  The
  string for each service name and resource type is the same as that embedded in a resource's
  Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Consult the AWS General Reference for the following: For more
  information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces. You
  can specify multiple resource types by using an array. The array can include up to 100
  items. Note that the length constraint requirement applies to each resource type filter.
- `"ResourcesPerPage"`: Specifies the maximum number of results to be returned in each
  page. A query can return fewer than this maximum, even if there are more results still to
  return. You should always check the PaginationToken response value to see if there are more
  results. You can specify a minimum of 1 and a maximum value of 100.
- `"TagFilters"`: Specifies a list of TagFilters (keys and values) to restrict the output
  to only those resources that have the specified tag and, if included, the specified value.
  Each TagFilter must contain a key with values optional. A request can include up to 50
  keys, and each key can include up to 20 values.  Note the following when deciding how to
  use TagFilters:   If you don't specify a TagFilter, the response includes all resources
  that are currently tagged or ever had a tag. Resources that currently don't have tags are
  shown with an empty tag set, like this: \"Tags\": [].   If you specify more than one filter
  in a single request, the response returns only those resources that satisfy all filters.
  If you specify a filter that contains more than one value for a key, the response returns
  resources that match any of the specified values for that key.   If you don't specify any
  values for a key, the response returns resources that are tagged with that key and any or
  no value. For example, for the following filters: filter1= {keyA,{value1}},
  filter2={keyB,{value2,value3,value4}}, filter3= {keyC}:    GetResources({filter1}) returns
  resources tagged with key1=value1     GetResources({filter2}) returns resources tagged with
  key2=value2 or key2=value3 or key2=value4     GetResources({filter3}) returns resources
  tagged with any tag with the key key3, and with any or no value
  GetResources({filter1,filter2,filter3}) returns resources tagged with (key1=value1) and
  (key2=value2 or key2=value3 or key2=value4) and (key3, any or no value)
- `"TagsPerPage"`: AWS recommends using ResourcesPerPage instead of this parameter. A limit
  that restricts the number of tags (key and value pairs) returned by GetResources in
  paginated output. A resource with no tags is counted as having one tag (one key and value
  pair).  GetResources does not split a resource and its associated tags across pages. If the
  specified TagsPerPage would cause such a break, a PaginationToken is returned in place of
  the affected resource and its tags. Use that token in another request to get the remaining
  data. For example, if you specify a TagsPerPage of 100 and the account has 22 resources
  with 10 tags each (meaning that each resource has 10 key and value pairs), the output will
  consist of three pages. The first page displays the first 10 resources, each with its 10
  tags. The second page displays the next 10 resources, each with its 10 tags. The third page
  displays the remaining 2 resources, each with its 10 tags. You can set TagsPerPage to a
  minimum of 100 items up to a maximum of 500 items.

    tag_resources(resource_arnlist, tags)
    tag_resources(resource_arnlist, tags, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Applies one or more tags to the specified resources. Note the following:   Not all
resources can have tags. For a list of services with resources that support tagging using
this operation, see Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API.   Each resource
can have up to 50 tags. For other limits, see Tag Naming and Usage Conventions in the AWS
General Reference.    You can only tag resources that are located in the specified AWS
Region for the AWS account.   To add tags to a resource, you need the necessary permissions
for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for adding tags. For
more information, see the documentation for each service.    Do not store personally
identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. We
use tags to provide you with billing and administration services. Tags are not intended to
be used for private or sensitive data.

# Arguments
- `resource_arnlist`: Specifies the list of ARNs of the resources that you want to apply
  tags to. An ARN (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource. For more
