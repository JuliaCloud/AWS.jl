    batch_get_service_level_objective_budget_report(slo_ids, timestamp)
    batch_get_service_level_objective_budget_report(slo_ids, timestamp, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Use this operation to retrieve one or more service level objective (SLO) budget reports. An
error budget is the amount of time or requests in an unhealthy state that your service can
accumulate during an interval before your overall SLO budget health is breached and the SLO
is considered to be unmet. For example, an SLO with a threshold of 99.95% and a monthly
interval translates to an error budget of 21.9 minutes of downtime in a 30-day month.
Budget reports include a health indicator, the attainment value, and remaining budget. For
more information about SLO error budgets, see  SLO concepts.

# Arguments
- `slo_ids`: An array containing the IDs of the service level objectives that you want to
  include in the report.
- `timestamp`: The date and time that you want the report to be for. It is expressed as the
  number of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

    create_service_level_objective(name)
    create_service_level_objective(name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a service level objective (SLO), which can help you ensure that your critical
business operations are meeting customer expectations. Use SLOs to set and track specific
target levels for the reliability and availability of your applications and services. SLOs
use service level indicators (SLIs) to calculate whether the application is performing at
the level that you want. Create an SLO to set a target for a service or operation’s
availability or latency. CloudWatch measures this target frequently you can find whether it
has been breached.  The target performance quality that is defined for an SLO is the
attainment goal. You can set SLO targets for your applications that are discovered by
Application Signals, using critical metrics such as latency and availability. You can also
set SLOs against any CloudWatch metric or math expression that produces a time series. When
you create an SLO, you specify whether it is a period-based SLO or a request-based SLO.
Each type of SLO has a different way of evaluating your application's performance against
its attainment goal.   A period-based SLO uses defined periods of time within a specified
total time interval. For each period of time, Application Signals determines whether the
application met its goal. The attainment rate is calculated as the number of good
periods/number of total periods. For example, for a period-based SLO, meeting an attainment
goal of 99.9% means that within your interval, your application must meet its performance
goal during at least 99.9% of the time periods.   A request-based SLO doesn't use
pre-defined periods of time. Instead, the SLO measures number of good requests/number of
total requests during the interval. At any time, you can find the ratio of good requests to
total requests for the interval up to the time stamp that you specify, and measure that
ratio against the goal set in your SLO.   After you have created an SLO, you can retrieve
error budget reports for it. An error budget is the amount of time or amount of requests
that your application can be non-compliant with the SLO's goal, and still have your
application meet the goal.   For a period-based SLO, the error budget starts at a number
defined by the highest number of periods that can fail to meet the threshold, while still
meeting the overall goal. The remaining error budget decreases with every failed period
that is recorded. The error budget within one interval can never increase. For example, an
SLO with a threshold that 99.95% of requests must be completed under 2000ms every month
translates to an error budget of 21.9 minutes of downtime per month.   For a request-based
SLO, the remaining error budget is dynamic and can increase or decrease, depending on the
ratio of good requests to total requests.   For more information about SLOs, see  Service
level objectives (SLOs).  When you perform a CreateServiceLevelObjective operation,
Application Signals creates the AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchApplicationSignals
service-linked role, if it doesn't already exist in your account. This service- linked role
has the following permissions:    xray:GetServiceGraph     logs:StartQuery
logs:GetQueryResults     cloudwatch:GetMetricData     cloudwatch:ListMetrics
tag:GetResources     autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups

# Arguments
- `name`: A name for this SLO.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: An optional description for this SLO.
- `"Goal"`: This structure contains the attributes that determine the goal of the SLO.
- `"RequestBasedSliConfig"`: If this SLO is a request-based SLO, this structure defines the
  information about what performance metric this SLO will monitor. You can't specify both
  RequestBasedSliConfig and SliConfig in the same operation.
- `"SliConfig"`: If this SLO is a period-based SLO, this structure defines the information
  about what performance metric this SLO will monitor. You can't specify both
  RequestBasedSliConfig and SliConfig in the same operation.
- `"Tags"`: A list of key-value pairs to associate with the SLO. You can associate as many
  as 50 tags with an SLO. To be able to associate tags with the SLO when you create the SLO,
  you must have the cloudwatch:TagResource permission. Tags can help you organize and
  categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a
  user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

    tag_resource(resource_arn, tags)
    tag_resource(resource_arn, tags, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch resource, such as a
service level objective. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can
also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change
only resources with certain tag values. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web
Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can use the TagResource
action with an alarm that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm,
this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag
key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces
the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch
resource.

# Arguments
- `resource_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch resource that you want
  to set tags for. The ARN format of an Application Signals SLO is

Updates an existing service level objective (SLO). If you omit parameters, the previous

request-based SLO, or change from a request-based SLO to a period-based SLO.

# Arguments
- `id`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of the service level objective that you want

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: An optional description for the SLO.
- `"Goal"`: A structure that contains the attributes that determine the goal of the SLO.
  This includes the time period for evaluation and the attainment threshold.
- `"RequestBasedSliConfig"`: If this SLO is a request-based SLO, this structure defines the
  information about what performance metric this SLO will monitor. You can't specify both
  SliConfig and RequestBasedSliConfig in the same operation.
- `"SliConfig"`: If this SLO is a period-based SLO, this structure defines the information
