    CreateGatewayRoute()

Creates a gateway route.
         A gateway route is attached to a virtual gateway and routes traffic to an existing
         virtual service. If a route matches a request, it can distribute traffic to a target virtual service.
         For more information about gateway routes, see Gateway routes.

Required Parameters
gatewayRouteName => The name to use for the gateway route.
meshName => The name of the service mesh to create the gateway route in.
spec => The gateway route specification to apply.
virtualGatewayName => The name of the virtual gateway to associate the gateway route with. If the virtual
         gateway is in a shared mesh, then you must be the owner of the virtual gateway
         resource.

Optional Parameters
clientToken => Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the
request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
meshOwner => The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then
               the account that you specify must share the mesh with your account before you can create 
             the resource in the service mesh. For more information about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes.
tags => Optional metadata that you can apply to the gateway route to assist with categorization
         and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you
         define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have
            a maximum length of 256 characters.

    CreateMesh()

Creates a service mesh.
          A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between services that are
         represented by resources within the mesh. After you create your service mesh, you can
         create virtual services, virtual nodes, virtual routers, and routes to distribute traffic
         between the applications in your mesh.

"""
    CreateVirtualGateway()

Creates a virtual gateway.
         A virtual gateway allows resources outside your mesh to communicate to resources that
         are inside your mesh. The virtual gateway represents an Envoy proxy running in an Amazon ECS
         task, in a Kubernetes service, or on an Amazon EC2 instance. Unlike a virtual node, which
         represents an Envoy running with an application, a virtual gateway represents Envoy deployed by itself.
         For more information about virtual gateways, see Virtual gateways.

meshName => The name of the service mesh to create the virtual gateway in.
spec => The virtual gateway specification to apply.

"""
    CreateVirtualNode()

Creates a virtual node within a service mesh.
          A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS
         service or a Kubernetes deployment. When you create a virtual node, you can specify the
         service discovery information for your task group, and whether the proxy running in a task
         group will communicate with other proxies using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
         You define a listener for any inbound traffic that your virtual node
         expects. Any virtual service that your virtual node expects to communicate to is specified
         as a backend.
         The response metadata for your new virtual node contains the arn that is
         associated with the virtual node. Set this value (either the full ARN or the truncated
         resource name: for example, mesh/default/virtualNode/simpleapp) as the
            APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_NAME environment variable for your task group's Envoy
         proxy container in your task definition or pod spec. This is then mapped to the
            node.id and node.cluster Envoy parameters.
         
            If you require your Envoy stats or tracing to use a different name, you can override
            the node.cluster value that is set by
               APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_NAME with the
               APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_CLUSTER environment variable.
         
         For more information about virtual nodes, see Virtual nodes.

Required Parameters
meshName => The name of the service mesh to create the virtual node in.

Creates a virtual router within a service mesh.

         receives. Create a virtual router for each protocol and port that you need to route.
         Virtual routers handle traffic for one or more virtual services within your mesh. After you
