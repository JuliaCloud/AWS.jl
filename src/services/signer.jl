    CancelSigningProfile()

Changes the state of an ACTIVE signing profile to CANCELED. A canceled profile is still viewable with the ListSigningProfiles operation, but it cannot perform new signing jobs, and is deleted two years after cancelation.

Required Parameters

}

    ListSigningJobs()

Lists all your signing jobs. You can use the maxResults parameter to limit the number of signing jobs that are returned in the response. If additional jobs remain to be listed, code signing returns a nextToken value. Use this value in subsequent calls to ListSigningJobs to fetch the remaining values. You can continue calling ListSigningJobs with your maxResults parameter and with new values that code signing returns in the nextToken parameter until all of your signing jobs have been returned. 

Optional Parameters
{
  "maxResults": "Specifies the maximum number of items to return in the response. Use this parameter when paginating results. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the nextToken element is set in the response. Use the nextToken value in a subsequent request to retrieve additional items. ",

Lists all available signing profiles in your AWS account. Returns only profiles with an ACTIVE status unless the includeCanceled request field is set to true.

    PutSigningProfile()

"""
    StartSigningJob()

Initiates a signing job to be performed on the code provided. Signing jobs are viewable by the ListSigningJobs operation for two years after they are performed. Note the following requirements:     You must create an Amazon S3 source bucket. For more information, see Create a Bucket in the Amazon S3 Getting Started Guide.    Your S3 source bucket must be version enabled.   You must create an S3 destination bucket. Code signing uses your S3 destination bucket to write your signed code.   You specify the name of the source and destination buckets when calling the StartSigningJob operation.   You must also specify a request token that identifies your request to code signing.   You can call the DescribeSigningJob and the ListSigningJobs actions after you call StartSigningJob. For a Java example that shows how to use this action, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/ 

Required Parameters
{
  "clientRequestToken": "String that identifies the signing request. All calls after the first that use this token return the same response as the first call.",
  "destination": "The S3 bucket in which to save your signed object. The destination contains the name of your bucket and an optional prefix.",
  "source": "The S3 bucket that contains the object to sign or a BLOB that contains your raw code."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "profileName": "The name of the signing profile."
}

"""
    TagResource()

Adds one or more tags to a signing profile. Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. To specify the signing profile, use its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). To specify the tag, use a key-value pair.

{
  "resourceArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the signing profile.",
