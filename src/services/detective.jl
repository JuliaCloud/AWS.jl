    accept_invitation(graph_arn)
    accept_invitation(graph_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Accepts an invitation for the member account to contribute data to a behavior graph. This
operation can only be called by an invited member account.  The request provides the ARN of
behavior graph. The member account status in the graph must be INVITED.

# Arguments
- `graph_arn`: The ARN of the behavior graph that the member account is accepting the
  invitation for. The member account status in the behavior graph must be INVITED.

    create_graph()
    create_graph(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as the
administrator account. This operation is called by the account that is enabling Detective.
Before you try to enable Detective, make sure that your account has been enrolled in Amazon
GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this requirement, you cannot enable
Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty prerequisite, then when you make the request to
enable Detective, it checks whether your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it
exceeds the quota, then you cannot enable Detective.  The operation also enables Detective
for the calling account in the currently selected Region. It returns the ARN of the new
behavior graph.  CreateGraph triggers a process to create the corresponding data tables for
the new behavior graph. An account can only be the administrator account for one behavior
graph within a Region. If the same account calls CreateGraph with the same administrator
account, it always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not create a new behavior
graph.

"""
    create_members(accounts, graph_arn)
    create_members(accounts, graph_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Sends a request to invite the specified AWS accounts to be member accounts in the behavior
graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator account for a behavior graph.
  CreateMembers verifies the accounts and then invites the verified accounts. The
administrator can optionally specify to not send invitation emails to the member accounts.
This would be used when the administrator manages their member accounts centrally. The
request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite. The response
separates the requested accounts into two lists:   The accounts that CreateMembers was able
to start the verification for. This list includes member accounts that are being verified,
that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed verification.
The accounts that CreateMembers was unable to process. This list includes accounts that
were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior graph.

# Arguments
- `accounts`: The list of AWS accounts to invite to become member accounts in the behavior
  graph. For each invited account, the account list contains the account identifier and the
  AWS account root user email address.
- `graph_arn`: The ARN of the behavior graph to invite the member accounts to contribute
  their data to.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DisableEmailNotification"`: if set to true, then the member accounts do not receive
  email notifications. By default, this is set to false, and the member accounts receive
  email notifications.
- `"Message"`: Customized message text to include in the invitation email message to the
  invited member accounts.

Disables the specified behavior graph and queues it to be deleted. This operation removes

Deletes one or more member accounts from the administrator account's behavior graph. This
operation can only be called by a Detective administrator account. That account cannot use
DeleteMembers to delete their own account from the behavior graph. To disable a behavior
graph, the administrator account uses the DeleteGraph API method.

Returns the list of behavior graphs that the calling account is an administrator account
of. This operation can only be called by an administrator account. Because an account can
currently only be the administrator of one behavior graph within a Region, the results
always contain a single behavior graph.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

  was returned with the previous set of results. The initial request does not include a
