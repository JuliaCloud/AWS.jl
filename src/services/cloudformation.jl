    cancel_update_stack(stack_name)
    cancel_update_stack(stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Cancels an update on the specified stack. If the call completes successfully, the stack
rolls back the update and reverts to the previous stack configuration.  You can cancel only
stacks that are in the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this CancelUpdateStack request. Specify
  this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not
  attempting to cancel an update on a stack with the same name. You might retry
  CancelUpdateStack requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

"""
    continue_update_rollback(stack_name)
    continue_update_rollback(stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

For a specified stack that is in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state, continues rolling it
back to the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can
manually  fix the error and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can
return your stack to a working state (the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state), and then try to
update the stack again. A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when AWS
CloudFormation cannot roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you
might have a stack that is rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted
outside of AWS CloudFormation. Because AWS CloudFormation doesn't know the database was
deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to
it, causing the update rollback to fail.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name or the unique ID of the stack that you want to continue rolling
  back.  Don't specify the name of a nested stack (a stack that was created by using the
  AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource). Instead, use this operation on the parent stack (the
  stack that contains the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this ContinueUpdateRollback request.
  Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that
  you're not attempting to continue the rollback to a stack with the same name. You might
  retry ContinueUpdateRollback requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully
  received them.
- `"ResourcesToSkip"`: A list of the logical IDs of the resources that AWS CloudFormation
  skips during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that
  are in the UPDATE_FAILED state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that
  are in the UPDATE_FAILED state for other reasons, for example, because an update was
  cancelled. To check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action,
  and view the resource status reason.   Specify this property to skip rolling back resources
  that AWS CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot
  resources before skipping them. AWS CloudFormation sets the status of the specified
  resources to UPDATE_COMPLETE and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is
  complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the
  resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update
  the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack
  updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.   Specify the minimum number
  of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource
  update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to
  skip the dependent resources.  To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the
  following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID. If you want to specify the logical ID
  of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then
  its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states:
  DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_COMPLETE, or DELETE_FAILED.   Don't confuse a child stack's name
  with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue
  update rollback operation with nested stacks, see Using ResourcesToSkip to recover a nested
  stacks hierarchy.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to roll back the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses
  the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this
  role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on
  the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to
  pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS
  CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is
  available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
  credentials.

"""
    create_change_set(change_set_name, stack_name)
    create_change_set(change_set_name, stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the
changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist
or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change
set shows all of the resources that AWS CloudFormation will create. If you create a change
set for an existing stack, AWS CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the
information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to
understand which resources AWS CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change
resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack. To create a change set
for a stack that doesn't exist, for the ChangeSetType parameter, specify CREATE. To create
a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE for the ChangeSetType parameter. To
create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT for the ChangeSetType
parameter. After the CreateChangeSet call successfully completes, AWS CloudFormation starts
creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the
DescribeChangeSet action. When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make,
execute the change set by using the ExecuteChangeSet action. AWS CloudFormation doesn't
make changes until you execute the change set. To create a change set for the entire stack
hierachy, set IncludeNestedStacks to True.

# Arguments
- `change_set_name`: The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change
  sets that are associated with the specified stack. A change set name can contain only
  alphanumeric, case sensitive characters and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic
  character and cannot exceed 128 characters.
- `stack_name`: The name or the unique ID of the stack for which you are creating a change
  set. AWS CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this stack's information with
  the information that you submit, such as a modified template or different parameter input
  values.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
  contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack.
  CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that
  can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by
  specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify
  either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources,
  you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must
  specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
  CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains
  these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit
  their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group
  AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User
   AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in
  AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros.
  Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like
  find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates.
  Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that
  they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack.
  If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack
  directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a
  change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and
  AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.  This capacity
  does not apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change sets has no
  effect. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested
  stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template using the
  CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and specifying this capability.  For more information on
  macros, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.
- `"ChangeSetType"`: The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new
  stack, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE. To
  create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT. If you create a change set for
  a new stack, AWS Cloudformation creates a stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or
  resources. The stack will be in the  REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS  state until you execute the change
  set. By default, AWS CloudFormation specifies UPDATE. You can't use the UPDATE type to
  create a change set for a new stack or the CREATE type to create a change set for an
  existing stack.
- `"ClientToken"`: A unique identifier for this CreateChangeSet request. Specify this token
  if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting
  to create another change set with the same name. You might retry CreateChangeSet requests
  to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.
- `"Description"`: A description to help you identify this change set.
- `"IncludeNestedStacks"`: Creates a change set for the all nested stacks specified in the
  template. The default behavior of this action is set to False. To include nested sets in a
  change set, specify True.
- `"NotificationARNs"`: The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon Simple Notification
  Service (Amazon SNS) topics that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. To remove
  all associated notification topics, specify an empty list.
- `"Parameters"`: A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
  change set. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
- `"ResourceTypes"`: The template resource types that you have permissions to work with if
  you execute this change set, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or
  Custom::MyCustomInstance. If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource type
  that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants
  permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this
  parameter for condition keys in IAM policies for AWS CloudFormation. For more information,
  see Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management in the AWS CloudFormation
  User Guide.
- `"ResourcesToImport"`: The resources to import into your stack.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes when executing the change set. AWS
  CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation
  uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to
  operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have
  permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a
  value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If
  no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from
  your user credentials.
- `"RollbackConfiguration"`: The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during
  stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also
  propagates these tags to resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags.
- `"TemplateBody"`: A structure that contains the body of the revised template, with a
  minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. AWS CloudFormation generates
  the change set by comparing this template with the template of the stack that you
  specified. Conditional: You must specify only TemplateBody or TemplateURL.
- `"TemplateURL"`: The location of the file that contains the revised template. The URL
  must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an S3 bucket or a
  Systems Manager document. AWS CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this
  template with the stack that you specified. Conditional: You must specify only TemplateBody
  or TemplateURL.
- `"UsePreviousTemplate"`: Whether to reuse the template that is associated with the stack
  to create the change set.

    create_stack(stack_name)
    create_stack(stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the
stack creation starts. You can check the status of the stack via the DescribeStacks API.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name that is associated with the stack. The name must be unique in the
  Region in which you are creating the stack.  A stack name can contain only alphanumeric
  characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and
  cannot be longer than 128 characters.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
  contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack.
  CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that

   AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in
  AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros.
  Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like
  find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates.
  Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that
  they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack.
  If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack
  directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a
  change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and
  AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. If you want to
  create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must
  create the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only create
  stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the
  macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing
  stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation
  without AWS CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using AWS
  CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this CreateStack request. Specify this
  token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not
  attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry CreateStack requests to
  ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given
  stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track
  operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then
  all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1.
  In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
  operations that are initiated from the console use the token format
  Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For
  example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the
  same token in the following format:
  Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
- `"DisableRollback"`: Set to true to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation
  failed. You can specify either DisableRollback or OnFailure, but not both. Default: false
- `"EnableTerminationProtection"`: Whether to enable termination protection on the
  specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled,
  the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see Protecting a
  Stack From Being Deleted in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Termination protection is
  disabled on stacks by default.   For nested stacks, termination protection is set on the
  root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.
- `"NotificationARNs"`: The Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic ARNs to publish stack
  related events. You can find your SNS topic ARNs using the SNS console or your Command Line
  Interface (CLI).
- `"OnFailure"`: Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be
  one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify either OnFailure or
  DisableRollback, but not both. Default: ROLLBACK
- `"Parameters"`: A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
  stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
- `"ResourceTypes"`: The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for
  this create stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or
  Custom::MyCustomInstance. Use the following syntax to describe template resource types:
  AWS::* (for all AWS resource), Custom::* (for all custom resources), Custom::logical_ID
  (for a specific custom resource), AWS::service_name::* (for all resources of a particular
  AWS service), and AWS::service_name::resource_logical_ID  (for a specific AWS resource). If
  the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack
  creation fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types.
  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS
  CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see
  Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the
  role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role
  for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the
  stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass
  it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS
  CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is
  available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
  credentials.
- `"RollbackConfiguration"`: The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during
  stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
- `"StackPolicyBody"`: Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go
  to  Prevent Updates to Stack Resources in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. You can
  specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.
- `"StackPolicyURL"`: Location of a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point to
  a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You
  can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also
  propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 50 tags
  can be specified.
- `"TemplateBody"`: Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte
  and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the
  AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the
  TemplateURL parameter, but not both.
- `"TemplateURL"`: Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a
  template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems
  Manager document. For more information, go to the Template Anatomy in the AWS
  CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the
  TemplateURL parameter, but not both.
- `"TimeoutInMinutes"`: The amount of time that can pass before the stack status becomes
  CREATE_FAILED; if DisableRollback is not set or is set to false, the stack will be rolled
  back.

Creates stack instances for the specified accounts, within the specified Regions. A stack
instance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region. You must specify at least one
value for either Accounts or DeploymentTargets, and you must specify at least one value for
Regions.

# Arguments
- `regions`: The names of one or more Regions where you want to create stack instances
  using the specified AWS account(s).
- `stack_set_name`: The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to create stack
  instances from.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Accounts"`: [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more AWS accounts that you
  want to create stack instances in the specified Region(s) for. You can specify Accounts or
  DeploymentTargets, but not both.
- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   If you are
  signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your AWS account
  must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more
  information, see Register a delegated administrator in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
- `"DeploymentTargets"`: [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts for
  which to create stack instances in the specified Regions. You can specify Accounts or
  DeploymentTargets, but not both.
- `"OperationId"`: The unique identifier for this stack set operation.  The operation ID
  also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the
  stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might
  retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received
  them. If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.  Repeating
  this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status
  is OUTDATED.
- `"OperationPreferences"`: Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set
  operation.
- `"ParameterOverrides"`: A list of stack set parameters whose values you want to override
  in the selected stack instances. Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all
  stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. When specifying parameters and their
  values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance
  operations:   To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and
  specify its value.   To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of the
  following:   Do not include the parameter in the list.   Include the parameter and specify
  UsePreviousValue as true. (You cannot specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to
  true.)     To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack set,
  specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters.   To leave all parameters set
  to their present values, do not specify this property at all.   During stack set updates,
  any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their
  overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the
  stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set
  template.

Creates a stack set.

# Arguments
- `stack_set_name`: The name to associate with the stack set. The name must be unique in
  the Region where you create your stack set.  A stack name can contain only alphanumeric
  characters (case-sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and
  can't be longer than 128 characters.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AdministrationRoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role to use to
  create this stack set.  Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator
  roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same
  administrator account. For more information, see Prerequisites: Granting Permissions for
  Stack Set Operations in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
- `"AutoDeployment"`: Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to AWS
  Organizations accounts that are added to the target organization or organizational unit
  (OU). Specify only if PermissionModel is SERVICE_MANAGED.
- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   To create a stack set with service-managed permissions while signed in to
  the management account, specify SELF.   To create a stack set with service-managed
  permissions while signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN.
  Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated admin in the management account. For
  more information, see Register a delegated administrator in the AWS CloudFormation User
  Guide.   Stack sets with service-managed permissions are created in the management account,
  including stack sets that are created by delegated administrators.
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set
  template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack
  set and related stack instances.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack
  templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for

  sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The
  following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either
  capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS

   AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in
  AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some templates contain macros. If
  your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly
  from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set,
  you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation
  Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.  Stack sets do not currently support
  macros in stack templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms,
  which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability, if you
  include a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this CreateStackSet request. Specify this
  token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not
  attempting to create another stack set with the same name. You might retry CreateStackSet
  requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify
  an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.
- `"Description"`: A description of the stack set. You can use the description to identify
  the stack set's purpose or other important information.
- `"ExecutionRoleName"`: The name of the IAM execution role to use to create the stack set.
  If you do not specify an execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses the
  AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM
  role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources
  users and groups can include in their stack sets.
- `"Parameters"`: The input parameters for the stack set template.
- `"PermissionModel"`: Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are
  created. By default, SELF-MANAGED is specified.   With self-managed permissions, you must
  create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For
  more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions.   With service-managed
  permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts
  managed by AWS Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed Stack Set
  Permissions.
- `"Tags"`: The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created
  from it. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are
  created in the stacks. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified. If you specify tags as
  part of a CreateStackSet action, AWS CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required
  IAM permission to tag resources. If you don't, the entire CreateStackSet action fails with
  an access denied error, and the stack set is not created.
- `"TemplateBody"`: The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length of
  1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, see Template Anatomy in
  the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or
  the TemplateURL parameter, but not both.
- `"TemplateURL"`: The location of the file that contains the template body. The URL must
  point to a template (maximum size: 460,800 bytes) that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or
  a Systems Manager document. For more information, see Template Anatomy in the AWS
  CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the
  TemplateURL parameter, but not both.

Deletes a specified stack. Once the call completes successfully, stack deletion starts.
Deleted stacks do not show up in the DescribeStacks API if the deletion has been completed
successfully.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this DeleteStack request. Specify this
  token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not
  attempting to delete a stack with the same name. You might retry DeleteStack requests to
  ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given
  stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track
  operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then
  all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1.
  In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
  operations that are initiated from the console use the token format
  Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For
  example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the
  same token in the following format:
  Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
- `"RetainResources"`: For stacks in the DELETE_FAILED state, a list of resource logical
  IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain. During deletion, AWS
  CloudFormation deletes the stack but does not delete the retained resources. Retaining
  resources is useful when you cannot delete a resource, such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but
  you want to delete the stack.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to delete the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the
  role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. If you don't specify a value, AWS
  CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is
  available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
  credentials.

- `"DeploymentTargets"`: [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts from
  which to delete stack instances. You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not
  both.
- `"OperationId"`: The unique identifier for this stack set operation.  If you don't
  specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.  The operation ID also
  functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set
  operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You can retry stack set

    detect_stack_drift(stack_name)
    detect_stack_drift(stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted, from it's expected
configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template
parameters. For each resource in the stack that supports drift detection, AWS
CloudFormation compares the actual configuration of the resource with its expected template
configuration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are
checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources
differ from their expected template configurations. For more information, see Detecting
Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources. Use DetectStackDrift to detect
drift on all supported resources for a given stack, or DetectStackResourceDrift to detect
drift on individual resources. For a list of stack resources that currently support drift
detection, see Resources that Support Drift Detection.  DetectStackDrift can take up to
several minutes, depending on the number of resources contained within the stack. Use
DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift
operation. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use
DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack and its resources.
When detecting drift on a stack, AWS CloudFormation does not detect drift on any nested
stacks belonging to that stack. Perform DetectStackDrift directly on the nested stack
itself.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name of the stack for which you want to detect drift.

    detect_stack_set_drift(stack_set_name)
    detect_stack_set_drift(stack_set_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Detect drift on a stack set. When CloudFormation performs drift detection on a stack set,
it performs drift detection on the stack associated with each stack instance in the stack
set. For more information, see How CloudFormation Performs Drift Detection on a Stack Set.
DetectStackSetDrift returns the OperationId of the stack set drift detection operation. Use
this operation id with  DescribeStackSetOperation  to monitor the progress of the drift
detection operation. The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on the
number of stack instances included in the stack set, as well as the number of resources
included in each stack. Once the operation has completed, use the following actions to
return drift information:   Use  DescribeStackSet  to return detailed information about the
stack set, including detailed information about the last completed drift operation
performed on the stack set. (Information about drift operations that are in progress is not
included.)   Use  ListStackInstances  to return a list of stack instances belonging to the
stack set, including the drift status and last drift time checked of each instance.   Use
DescribeStackInstance  to return detailed information about a specific stack instance,
including its drift status and last drift time checked.   For more information on
performing a drift detection operation on a stack set, see Detecting Unmanaged Changes in
Stack Sets.  You can only run a single drift detection operation on a given stack set at
one time.  To stop a drift detection stack set operation, use  StopStackSetOperation .

Validating the extension schema   Determining which handlers, if any, have been specified
for the extension   Making the extension available for use in your account   For more
information on how to develop extensions and ready them for registeration, see Creating
Resource Providers in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide. You can have a maximum of 50
resource extension versions registered at a time. This maximum is per account and per
region. Use DeregisterType to deregister specific extension versions if necessary. Once you
have initiated a registration request using  RegisterType , you can use
DescribeTypeRegistration  to monitor the progress of the registration request.

# Arguments
- `schema_handler_package`: A url to the S3 bucket containing the extension project package
  that contains the neccessary files for the extension you want to register. For information
  on generating a schema handler package for the extension you want to register, see submit
  in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide.  The user registering the extension must be able to
  access the package in the S3 bucket. That is, the user needs to have GetObject permissions
  for the schema handler package. For more information, see Actions, Resources, and Condition
  Keys for Amazon S3 in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- `type_name`: The name of the extension being registered. We recommend that extension
  names adhere to the following pattern: company_or_organization::service::type.  The
  following organization namespaces are reserved and cannot be used in your extension names:

  generating more than one version of an extension from the same registeration request, even
  if the request is submitted multiple times.
- `"ExecutionRoleArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation
  to assume when invoking the extension. If your extension calls AWS APIs in any of its
  handlers, you must create an  IAM execution role  that includes the necessary permissions
  to call those AWS APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When
  CloudFormation needs to invoke the extension handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution
  role to create a temporary session token, which it then passes to the extension handler,
  thereby supplying your extension with the appropriate credentials.
- `"LoggingConfig"`: Specifies logging configuration information for an extension.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name or unique stack ID of the stack to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
  contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to update the stack.
  CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that
  can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by
  specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify
  either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources,
  you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must
  specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
  CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains
  these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit
  their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group
  AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User
   AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in
  AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros.
  Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like
  find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates.
  Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that
  they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack.
  If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack
  directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a
  change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and
  AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. If you want to
  update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must
  update the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only update
  stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the
  macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing
  stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation
  without AWS CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using AWS
  CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this UpdateStack request. Specify this
  token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not
  attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might retry UpdateStack requests to
  ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given
  stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track
  operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then
  all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1.
  In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
  operations that are initiated from the console use the token format
  Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For
  example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the
  same token in the following format:
  Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
- `"NotificationARNs"`: Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names
  (ARNs) that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to remove
  all notification topics.
- `"Parameters"`: A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
  stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
- `"ResourceTypes"`: The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for
  this update stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or
  Custom::MyCustomInstance. If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that
  you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions
  to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS
  CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see
  Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the
  role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role
  for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the
  stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass
  it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS
  CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is
  available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
  credentials.
- `"RollbackConfiguration"`: The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during
  stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
- `"StackPolicyBody"`: Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either
  the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both. You might update the
  stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a
  stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated
  with the stack is unchanged.
- `"StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody"`: Structure containing the temporary overriding stack
  policy body. You can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the
  StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both. If you want to update protected
  resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not
  specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used.
- `"StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL"`: Location of a file containing the temporary overriding
  stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in
  the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the
  StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both. If you want to update protected
  resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not
  specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used.
- `"StackPolicyURL"`: Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must
  point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack.
  You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.
  You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you
  created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy
  that is associated with the stack is unchanged.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also
  propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum number
  of 50 tags. If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't modify the
  stack's tags. If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all associated tags.
- `"TemplateBody"`: Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte
  and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. (For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the
  AWS CloudFormation User Guide.) Conditional: You must specify only one of the following
  parameters: TemplateBody, TemplateURL, or set the UsePreviousTemplate to true.
- `"TemplateURL"`: Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a
  template that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. For more
  information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You
  must specify only one of the following parameters: TemplateBody, TemplateURL, or set the
  UsePreviousTemplate to true.

create additional stack instances, use CreateStackInstances.  During stack set updates, any
parameters overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden
value. You can only update the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add
or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you
add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the
stack set you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all stack instances with the updated
template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been
updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using
UpdateStackInstances.

# Arguments
- `regions`: The names of one or more Regions in which you want to update parameter values
  for stack instances. The overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances
  in the specified accounts and Regions.
- `stack_set_name`: The name or unique ID of the stack set associated with the stack
  instances.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Accounts"`: [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more AWS accounts for which
  you want to update parameter values for stack instances. The overridden parameter values
  will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. You can
  specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not both.
- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   If you are
  signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your AWS account
  must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more
  information, see Register a delegated administrator in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
- `"DeploymentTargets"`: [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts for
  which you want to update parameter values for stack instances. If your update targets OUs,
  the overridden parameter values only apply to the accounts that are currently in the target
  OUs and their child OUs. Accounts added to the target OUs and their child OUs in the future
  won't use the overridden values. You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not
  both.
- `"OperationId"`: The unique identifier for this stack set operation.  The operation ID
  also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the
  stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might
  retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received
  them. If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.
- `"OperationPreferences"`: Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set
  operation.
- `"ParameterOverrides"`:  A list of input parameters whose values you want to update for
  the specified stack instances.  Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all
  stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. When specifying parameters and their
  values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance
  update operations:   To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter
  and specify its value.   To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of
  the following:   Do not include the parameter in the list.   Include the parameter and
  specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You cannot specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue
  to true.)     To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack
  set, specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters.   To leave all parameters
  set to their present values, do not specify this property at all.   During stack set
  updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain
  their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in
  the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack
  set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter
  value specified in the stack set you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all stack
  instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a
  stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter
  value using UpdateStackInstances.

    update_stack_set(stack_set_name)
    update_stack_set(stack_set_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates the stack set, and associated stack instances in the specified accounts and
Regions. Even if the stack set operation created by updating the stack set fails
(completely or partially, below or above a specified failure tolerance), the stack set is
updated with your changes. Subsequent CreateStackInstances calls on the specified stack set
use the updated stack set.

# Arguments
- `stack_set_name`: The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Accounts"`: [Self-managed permissions] The accounts in which to update associated stack
  instances. If you specify accounts, you must also specify the Regions in which to update
  stack set instances. To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do
  not specify the Accounts or Regions properties. If the stack set update includes changes to
  the template (that is, if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the
  Parameters property, AWS CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED
  prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack
  set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation
  updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other
  stack instances with their existing stack instance status.
- `"AdministrationRoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role to use to
  update this stack set. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator
  roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same
  administrator account. For more information, see Granting Permissions for Stack Set
  Operations in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. If you specified a customized
  administrator role when you created the stack set, you must specify a customized
  administrator role, even if it is the same customized administrator role used with this
  stack set previously.
- `"AutoDeployment"`: [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets
  automatically deploys to AWS Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization
  or organizational unit (OU). If you specify AutoDeployment, do not specify
  DeploymentTargets or Regions.
- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   If you are
  signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your AWS account
  must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more
  information, see Register a delegated administrator in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
  contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to update the stack set and
  its associated stack instances.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack
  templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for
  example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks
  sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The
  following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either
  capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
  CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains
  these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit
  their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group
  AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User
   AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in
  AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some templates contain macros. If
  your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly
  from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set,
  you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation
  Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.  Stack sets do not currently support
  macros in stack templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms,
  which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability, if you
  include a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.
- `"DeploymentTargets"`: [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts in
  which to update associated stack instances. To update all the stack instances associated
  with this stack set, do not specify DeploymentTargets or Regions. If the stack set update
  includes changes to the template (that is, if TemplateBody or TemplateURL is specified), or
  the Parameters, AWS CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED
  prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack
  set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation
  updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other
  stack instances with their existing stack instance status.
- `"Description"`: A brief description of updates that you are making.
- `"ExecutionRoleName"`: The name of the IAM execution role to use to update the stack set.
  If you do not specify an execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses the
  AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM
  role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources
  users and groups can include in their stack sets.   If you specify a customized execution
  role, AWS CloudFormation uses that role to update the stack. If you do not specify a
  customized execution role, AWS CloudFormation performs the update using the role previously
  associated with the stack set, so long as you have permissions to perform operations on the
  stack set.
- `"OperationId"`: The unique ID for this stack set operation.  The operation ID also
  functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set
  operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack
  set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. If you
  don't specify an operation ID, AWS CloudFormation generates one automatically. Repeating
  this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status
  is OUTDATED.
- `"OperationPreferences"`: Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set
  operation.
- `"Parameters"`: A list of input parameters for the stack set template.
- `"PermissionModel"`: Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are
  created. You cannot modify PermissionModel if there are stack instances associated with
  your stack set.   With self-managed permissions, you must create the administrator and
  execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see Grant
  Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions.   With service-managed permissions, StackSets
  automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by AWS
  Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed Stack Set Permissions.
- `"Regions"`: The Regions in which to update associated stack instances. If you specify
  Regions, you must also specify accounts in which to update stack set instances. To update
  all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify the Accounts or
  Regions properties. If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if
  the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the Parameters property, AWS
  CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED prior to updating the
  stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not
  include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation updates the stack
  instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances
  with their existing stack instance status.
- `"Tags"`: The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created
  from it. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are
  created in the stacks. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags. If you specify tags for
  this parameter, those tags replace any list of tags that are currently associated with this
  stack set. This means:   If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't
  modify the stack's tags.    If you specify any tags using this parameter, you must specify
  all the tags that you want associated with this stack set, even tags you've specifed before
  (for example, when creating the stack set or during a previous update of the stack set.).
  Any tags that you don't include in the updated list of tags are removed from the stack set,
  and therefore from the stacks and resources as well.    If you specify an empty value, AWS
  CloudFormation removes all currently associated tags.   If you specify new tags as part of
  an UpdateStackSet action, AWS CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM
  permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the stack
  set from the list of tags you specify, AWS CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove
  those tags from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources.
  If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire UpdateStackSet action fails with
  an access denied error, and the stack set is not updated.
- `"TemplateBody"`: The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length of
  1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, see Template Anatomy in
  the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following
  parameters: TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.
- `"TemplateURL"`: The location of the file that contains the template body. The URL must
  point to a template (maximum size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket or
  a Systems Manager document. For more information, see Template Anatomy in the AWS
  CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following
  parameters: TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.
- `"UsePreviousTemplate"`: Use the existing template that's associated with the stack set
  that you're updating. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
  TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.

    validate_template()
