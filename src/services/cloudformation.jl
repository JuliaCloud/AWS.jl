    activate_type()
    activate_type(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Activates a public third-party extension, making it available for use in stack templates.
For more information, see Using public extensions in the CloudFormation User Guide. Once
you have activated a public third-party extension in your account and region, use
SetTypeConfiguration to specify configuration properties for the extension. For more
information, see Configuring extensions at the account level in the CloudFormation User
Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AutoUpdate"`: Whether to automatically update the extension in this account and region
  when a new minor version is published by the extension publisher. Major versions released
  by the publisher must be manually updated. The default is true.
- `"ExecutionRoleArn"`: The name of the IAM execution role to use to activate the extension.
- `"LoggingConfig"`:
- `"MajorVersion"`: The major version of this extension you want to activate, if multiple
  major versions are available. The default is the latest major version. CloudFormation uses
  the latest available minor version of the major version selected. You can specify
  MajorVersion or VersionBump, but not both.
- `"PublicTypeArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the public extension. Conditional:
  You must specify PublicTypeArn, or TypeName, Type, and PublisherId.
- `"PublisherId"`: The ID of the extension publisher. Conditional: You must specify
  PublicTypeArn, or TypeName, Type, and PublisherId.
- `"Type"`: The extension type. Conditional: You must specify PublicTypeArn, or TypeName,
  Type, and PublisherId.
- `"TypeName"`: The name of the extension. Conditional: You must specify PublicTypeArn, or
  TypeName, Type, and PublisherId.
- `"TypeNameAlias"`: An alias to assign to the public extension, in this account and
  region. If you specify an alias for the extension, CloudFormation treats the alias as the
  extension type name within this account and region. You must use the alias to refer to the
  extension in your templates, API calls, and CloudFormation console. An extension alias must
  be unique within a given account and region. You can activate the same public resource
  multiple times in the same account and region, using different type name aliases.
- `"VersionBump"`: Manually updates a previously-activated type to a new major or minor
  version, if available. You can also use this parameter to update the value of AutoUpdate.
   MAJOR: CloudFormation updates the extension to the newest major version, if one is
  available.    MINOR: CloudFormation updates the extension to the newest minor version, if
  one is available.

"""
    continue_update_rollback(stack_name)
    continue_update_rollback(stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

For a specified stack that's in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state, continues rolling it back
to the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can
manually  fix the error and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can
return your stack to a working state (the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state), and then try to
update the stack again. A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when
CloudFormation can't roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you
might have a stack that's rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside
of CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes
that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update
rollback to fail.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name or the unique ID of the stack that you want to continue rolling
  back.  Don't specify the name of a nested stack (a stack that was created by using the
  AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource). Instead, use this operation on the parent stack (the
  stack that contains the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this ContinueUpdateRollback request.
  Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormationknows that you're
  not attempting to continue the rollback to a stack with the same name. You might retry
  ContinueUpdateRollback requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.
- `"ResourcesToSkip"`: A list of the logical IDs of the resources that CloudFormation skips
  during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that are in
  the UPDATE_FAILED state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in
  the UPDATE_FAILED state for other reasons, for example, because an update was canceled. To
  check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action, and view the
  resource status reason.  Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that
  CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources
  before skipping them. CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to
  UPDATE_COMPLETE and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the
  state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the
  stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or
  resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might
  fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.  Specify the minimum number of resources
  required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might
  cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the
  dependent resources. To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following
  format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack
  resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its
  corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: DELETE_IN_PROGRESS,
  DELETE_COMPLETE, or DELETE_FAILED.  Don't confuse a child stack's name with its
  corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update
  rollback operation with nested stacks, see Using ResourcesToSkip to recover a nested stacks
  hierarchy.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  role that CloudFormation assumes to roll back the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's
  credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all
  future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the
  stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it.
  Ensure that the role grants least permission. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation
  uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
  CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your user credentials.

    create_change_set(change_set_name, stack_name)
    create_change_set(change_set_name, stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the
changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist
or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change
set shows all of the resources that CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set
for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information
that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand
which resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in
an existing stack, before you create or update a stack. To create a change set for a stack
that doesn't exist, for the ChangeSetType parameter, specify CREATE. To create a change set
for an existing stack, specify UPDATE for the ChangeSetType parameter. To create a change
set for an import operation, specify IMPORT for the ChangeSetType parameter. After the
CreateChangeSet call successfully completes, CloudFormation starts creating the change set.
To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the DescribeChangeSet action.
When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by
using the ExecuteChangeSet action. CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute
the change set. To create a change set for the entire stack hierarchy, set
IncludeNestedStacks to True.

# Arguments
- `change_set_name`: The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change
  sets that are associated with the specified stack. A change set name can contain only
  alphanumeric, case sensitive characters, and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetical
  character and can't exceed 128 characters.
- `stack_name`: The name or the unique ID of the stack for which you are creating a change
  set. CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this stack's information with the
  information that you submit, such as a modified template or different parameter input
  values.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
  contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.
  CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that
  can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly
  acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources
  require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If
  you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with
  custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these
  capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack
  template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated
  with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey
  AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role
   AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see
  Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some
  template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include
  simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations
  of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the
  processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before
  actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you
  choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the
  resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the
  AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.
  This capacity doesn't apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change
  sets has no effect. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains
  macros and nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template
  using the CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and specifying this capability.  For more
  information about macros, see Using CloudFormation macros to perform custom processing on
  templates.
- `"ChangeSetType"`: The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new
  stack, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE. To
  create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT. If you create a change set for
  a new stack, CloudFormation creates a stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or
  resources. The stack will be in the  REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS  state until you execute the change
  set. By default, CloudFormation specifies UPDATE. You can't use the UPDATE type to create a
  change set for a new stack or the CREATE type to create a change set for an existing stack.
- `"ClientToken"`: A unique identifier for this CreateChangeSet request. Specify this token
  if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to
  create another change set with the same name. You might retry CreateChangeSet requests to
  ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.
- `"Description"`: A description to help you identify this change set.
- `"IncludeNestedStacks"`: Creates a change set for the all nested stacks specified in the
  template. The default behavior of this action is set to False. To include nested sets in a
  change set, specify True.
- `"NotificationARNs"`: The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon Simple Notification
  Service (Amazon SNS) topics that CloudFormation associates with the stack. To remove all
  associated notification topics, specify an empty list.
- `"Parameters"`: A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
  change set. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
- `"ResourceTypes"`: The template resource types that you have permissions to work with if
  you execute this change set, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or
  Custom::MyCustomInstance. If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource type
  that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions
  to all resource types. Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for
  condition keys in IAM policies for CloudFormation. For more information, see Controlling
  access with Identity and Access Management in the CloudFormation User Guide.
- `"ResourcesToImport"`: The resources to import into your stack.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  role that CloudFormation assumes when executing the change set. CloudFormation uses the
  role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation uses this role for all
  future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the
  stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it.
  Ensure that the role grants least permission. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation
  uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
  CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.
- `"RollbackConfiguration"`: The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during
  stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates
  these tags to resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags.
- `"TemplateBody"`: A structure that contains the body of the revised template, with a
  minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. CloudFormation generates the
  change set by comparing this template with the template of the stack that you specified.
  Conditional: You must specify only TemplateBody or TemplateURL.
- `"TemplateURL"`: The location of the file that contains the revised template. The URL
  must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or
  a Systems Manager document. CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this
  template with the stack that you specified. Conditional: You must specify only TemplateBody
  or TemplateURL.
- `"UsePreviousTemplate"`: Whether to reuse the template that's associated with the stack
  to create the change set.

    create_stack(stack_name)
    create_stack(stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the
stack creation starts. You can check the status of the stack through the
DescribeStacksoperation.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name that's associated with the stack. The name must be unique in the
  Region in which you are creating the stack.  A stack name can contain only alphanumeric
  characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetical character and
  can't be longer than 128 characters.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

  AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role
   AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see
  Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some
  template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include
  simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations
  of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the
  processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before
  actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you
  choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the
  resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the
  AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If
  you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks,
  you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should
  only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what
  processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function
  for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the
  function operation without CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using
  CloudFormation macros to perform custom processing on templates.
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this CreateStack request. Specify this
  token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting
  to create a stack with the same name. You might retry CreateStack requests to ensure that
  CloudFormation successfully received them. All events initiated by a given stack operation
  are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For
  example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the
  StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the
  console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
  operations that are initiated from the console use the token format
  Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For
  example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the
  same token in the following format:
  Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
- `"DisableRollback"`: Set to true to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation
  failed. You can specify either DisableRollback or OnFailure, but not both. Default: false
- `"EnableTerminationProtection"`: Whether to enable termination protection on the
  specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled,
  the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see Protecting a
  Stack From Being Deleted in the CloudFormation User Guide. Termination protection is
  deactivated on stacks by default. For nested stacks, termination protection is set on the
  root stack and can't be changed directly on the nested stack.
- `"NotificationARNs"`: The Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic ARNs to
  publish stack related events. You can find your Amazon SNS topic ARNs using the Amazon SNS
  console or your Command Line Interface (CLI).
- `"OnFailure"`: Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be
  one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify either OnFailure or
  DisableRollback, but not both. Default: ROLLBACK
- `"Parameters"`: A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
  stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
- `"ResourceTypes"`: The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for
  this create stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or
  Custom::MyCustomInstance. Use the following syntax to describe template resource types:
  AWS::* (for all Amazon Web Services resources), Custom::* (for all custom resources),
  Custom::logical_ID  (for a specific custom resource), AWS::service_name::* (for all
  resources of a particular Amazon Web Services service), and
  AWS::service_name::resource_logical_ID  (for a specific Amazon Web Services resource). If
  the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack
  creation fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types.
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific
  condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling Access with Identity
  and Access Management.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  role that CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's
  credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all
  future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the
  stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it.
  Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation
  uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
  CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your user credentials.
- `"RollbackConfiguration"`: The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during
  stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
- `"StackPolicyBody"`: Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go
  to  Prevent Updates to Stack Resources in the CloudFormation User Guide. You can specify
  either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.
- `"StackPolicyURL"`: Location of a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point to
  a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You
  can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates
  these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 50 tags can be
  specified.
- `"TemplateBody"`: Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte
  and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go to Template anatomy in the
  CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the
  TemplateURL parameter, but not both.
- `"TemplateURL"`: Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a
  template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems
  Manager document. For more information, go to the Template anatomy in the CloudFormation
  User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL
  parameter, but not both.
- `"TimeoutInMinutes"`: The amount of time that can pass before the stack status becomes
  CREATE_FAILED; if DisableRollback is not set or is set to false, the stack will be rolled
  back.

    create_stack_instances(regions, stack_set_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates stack instances for the specified accounts, within the specified Amazon Web
Services Regions. A stack instance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region. You
must specify at least one value for either Accounts or DeploymentTargets, and you must
specify at least one value for Regions.

# Arguments
- `regions`: The names of one or more Amazon Web Services Regions where you want to create
  stack instances using the specified Amazon Web Services accounts.
- `stack_set_name`: The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to create stack
  instances from.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Accounts"`: [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more Amazon Web Services
  accounts that you want to create stack instances in the specified Region(s) for. You can
  specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not both.
- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   If you are
  signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your Amazon Web
  Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account.
  For more information, see Register a delegated administrator in the CloudFormation User
  Guide.
- `"DeploymentTargets"`: [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts for which
  to create stack instances in the specified Amazon Web Services Regions. You can specify
  Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not both.
- `"OperationId"`: The unique identifier for this stack set operation. The operation ID
  also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that CloudFormation performs the stack
  set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry
  stack set operation requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. If
  you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically. Repeating this
  stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is
  OUTDATED.
- `"OperationPreferences"`: Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this stack set
  operation.
- `"ParameterOverrides"`: A list of stack set parameters whose values you want to override
  in the selected stack instances. Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all
  stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. When specifying
  parameters and their values, be aware of how CloudFormation sets parameter values during
  stack instance operations:   To override the current value for a parameter, include the
  parameter and specify its value.   To leave an overridden parameter set to its present
  value, include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You can't specify both
  a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)   To set an overridden parameter back to the
  value specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but don't include the parameter
  in the list.   To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify this
  property at all.   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack
  instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the
  parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself,
  use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template.

"""
    create_stack_set(stack_set_name)
    create_stack_set(stack_set_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a stack set.

# Arguments
- `stack_set_name`: The name to associate with the stack set. The name must be unique in
  the Region where you create your stack set.  A stack name can contain only alphanumeric
  characters (case-sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and
  can't be longer than 128 characters.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AdministrationRoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to use to
  create this stack set. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator
  roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same
  administrator account. For more information, see Prerequisites: Granting Permissions for
  Stack Set Operations in the CloudFormation User Guide.
- `"AutoDeployment"`: Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to Organizations
  accounts that are added to the target organization or organizational unit (OU). Specify
  only if PermissionModel is SERVICE_MANAGED.
- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   To create a stack set with service-managed permissions while signed in to
  the management account, specify SELF.   To create a stack set with service-managed
  permissions while signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN.
  Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated admin in the management
  account. For more information, see Register a delegated administrator in the CloudFormation
  User Guide.   Stack sets with service-managed permissions are created in the management
  account, including stack sets that are created by delegated administrators.
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set
  template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack set
  and related stack instances.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack
  templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services
  account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those
  stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.
  The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either
  capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation
  returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these
  resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
  permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group
  AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User
  AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in
  CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some templates reference macros. If
  your stack set template references one or more macros, you must create the stack set
  directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a
  change set. To create the stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For
  more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on
  Templates.  Stack sets with service-managed permissions don't currently support the use of
  macros in templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which
  are macros hosted by CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability for a stack set
  with service-managed permissions, if you reference a macro in your template the stack set
  operation will fail.
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this CreateStackSet request. Specify this
  token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting
  to create another stack set with the same name. You might retry CreateStackSet requests to
  ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify an operation
  ID, the SDK generates one automatically.
- `"Description"`: A description of the stack set. You can use the description to identify
  the stack set's purpose or other important information.
- `"ExecutionRoleName"`: The name of the IAM execution role to use to create the stack set.
  If you do not specify an execution role, CloudFormation uses the
  AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM
  role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources
  users and groups can include in their stack sets.
- `"ManagedExecution"`: Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations
  concurrently and queues conflicting operations.
- `"Parameters"`: The input parameters for the stack set template.
- `"PermissionModel"`: Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are
  created. By default, SELF-MANAGED is specified.   With self-managed permissions, you must
  create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For
  more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions.   With service-managed
  permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts
  managed by Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed Stack Set
  Permissions.
- `"StackId"`: The stack ID you are importing into a new stack set. Specify the Amazon
  Resource Name (ARN) of the stack.
- `"Tags"`: The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created
  from it. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created
  in the stacks. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified. If you specify tags as part of
  a CreateStackSet action, CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM
  permission to tag resources. If you don't, the entire CreateStackSet action fails with an
  access denied error, and the stack set is not created.
- `"TemplateBody"`: The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length of
  1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, see Template Anatomy in
  the CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the
  TemplateURL parameter, but not both.
- `"TemplateURL"`: The location of the file that contains the template body. The URL must
  point to a template (maximum size: 460,800 bytes) that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or
  a Systems Manager document. For more information, see Template Anatomy in the
  CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the
  TemplateURL parameter, but not both.

Deletes a specified stack. Once the call completes successfully, stack deletion starts.
Deleted stacks don't show up in the DescribeStacks operation if the deletion has been
completed successfully.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name or the unique stack ID that's associated with the stack.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this DeleteStack request. Specify this
  token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting
  to delete a stack with the same name. You might retry DeleteStack requests to ensure that
  CloudFormation successfully received them. All events initiated by a given stack operation
  are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For
  example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the
  StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the
  console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
  operations that are initiated from the console use the token format
  Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For
  example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the
  same token in the following format:
  Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
- `"RetainResources"`: For stacks in the DELETE_FAILED state, a list of resource logical
  IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain. During deletion,
  CloudFormation deletes the stack but doesn't delete the retained resources. Retaining
  resources is useful when you can't delete a resource, such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but
  you want to delete the stack.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  role that CloudFormation assumes to delete the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's
  credentials to make calls on your behalf. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses
  the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
  CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your user credentials.

    detect_stack_drift(stack_name)
    detect_stack_drift(stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted, from it's expected
configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template
parameters. For each resource in the stack that supports drift detection, CloudFormation
compares the actual configuration of the resource with its expected template configuration.
Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. A
stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their
expected template configurations. For more information, see Detecting Unregulated
Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources. Use DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all
supported resources for a given stack, or DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on
individual resources. For a list of stack resources that currently support drift detection,
see Resources that Support Drift Detection.  DetectStackDrift can take up to several
minutes, depending on the number of resources contained within the stack. Use
DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift
operation. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use
DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack and its resources.
When detecting drift on a stack, CloudFormation doesn't detect drift on any nested stacks
belonging to that stack. Perform DetectStackDrift directly on the nested stack itself.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name of the stack for which you want to detect drift.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

Detect drift on a stack set. When CloudFormation performs drift detection on a stack set,
it performs drift detection on the stack associated with each stack instance in the stack
set. For more information, see How CloudFormation performs drift detection on a stack set.
DetectStackSetDrift returns the OperationId of the stack set drift detection operation. Use
this operation id with  DescribeStackSetOperation  to monitor the progress of the drift
detection operation. The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on the
number of stack instances included in the stack set, in addition to the number of resources
included in each stack. Once the operation has completed, use the following actions to
return drift information:   Use  DescribeStackSet  to return detailed information about the
stack set, including detailed information about the last completed drift operation
performed on the stack set. (Information about drift operations that are in progress isn't
included.)   Use  ListStackInstances  to return a list of stack instances belonging to the
stack set, including the drift status and last drift time checked of each instance.   Use
DescribeStackInstance  to return detailed information about a specific stack instance,
including its drift status and last drift time checked.   For more information about
performing a drift detection operation on a stack set, see Detecting unmanaged changes in
stack sets. You can only run a single drift detection operation on a given stack set at one
time. To stop a drift detection stack set operation, use  StopStackSetOperation .

- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   If you are
  signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your Amazon Web
  Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account.
  For more information, see Register a delegated administrator in the CloudFormation User
  Guide.
- `"Filters"`: The status that stack instances are filtered by.
- `"MaxResults"`: The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the
  number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a NextToken value
  that you can assign to the NextToken request parameter to get the next set of results.
- `"NextToken"`: If the previous request didn't return all the remaining results, the
  response's NextToken parameter value is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of
  results, call ListStackInstances again and assign that token to the request object's
  NextToken parameter. If there are no remaining results, the previous response object's
  NextToken parameter is set to null.
- `"StackInstanceAccount"`: The name of the Amazon Web Services account that you want to
  list stack instances for.
- `"StackInstanceRegion"`: The name of the Region where you want to list stack instances.

Registers an extension with the CloudFormation service. Registering an extension makes it
available for use in CloudFormation templates in your Amazon Web Services account, and
includes:   Validating the extension schema.   Determining which handlers, if any, have
been specified for the extension.   Making the extension available for use in your account.
  For more information about how to develop extensions and ready them for registration, see
Creating Resource Providers in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide. You can have a maximum of
50 resource extension versions registered at a time. This maximum is per account and per
region. Use DeregisterType to deregister specific extension versions if necessary. Once you
have initiated a registration request using  RegisterType , you can use
DescribeTypeRegistration  to monitor the progress of the registration request. Once you
have registered a private extension in your account and region, use SetTypeConfiguration to
specify configuration properties for the extension. For more information, see Configuring
extensions at the account level in the CloudFormation User Guide.

# Arguments
- `schema_handler_package`: A URL to the S3 bucket containing the extension project package
  that contains the necessary files for the extension you want to register. For information
  about generating a schema handler package for the extension you want to register, see
  submit in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide.  The user registering the extension must be
  able to access the package in the S3 bucket. That's, the user needs to have GetObject
  permissions for the schema handler package. For more information, see Actions, Resources,
  and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 in the Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- `type_name`: The name of the extension being registered. We suggest that extension names
  adhere to the following patterns:   For resource types,

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier that acts as an idempotency key for this
  registration request. Specifying a client request token prevents CloudFormation from
  generating more than one version of an extension from the same registration request, even
  if the request is submitted multiple times.
- `"ExecutionRoleArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation
  to assume when invoking the extension. For CloudFormation to assume the specified execution
  role, the role must contain a trust relationship with the CloudFormation service principle
  (resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com). For more information about adding trust
  relationships, see Modifying a role trust policy in the Identity and Access Management User
  Guide. If your extension calls Amazon Web Services APIs in any of its handlers, you must
  create an  IAM execution role  that includes the necessary permissions to call those Amazon
  Web Services APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When CloudFormation
  needs to invoke the resource type handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution role to
  create a temporary session token, which it then passes to the resource type handler,
  thereby supplying your resource type with the appropriate credentials.
- `"LoggingConfig"`: Specifies logging configuration information for an extension.
- `"Type"`: The kind of extension.

- `stack_name`: The stack name or unique stack ID that includes the resource that you want
  to signal.
- `status`: The status of the signal, which is either success or failure. A failure signal
  causes CloudFormation to immediately fail the stack creation or update.
- `unique_id`: A unique ID of the signal. When you signal Amazon EC2 instances or Auto
  Scaling groups, specify the instance ID that you are signaling as the unique ID. If you
  send multiple signals to a single resource (such as signaling a wait condition), each

module's model meets all necessary requirements.   For more information, see Testing your
public extension prior to publishing in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide. If you don't
specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version of the extension in your account
and region for testing. To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role
specified when the type was registered. For more information, see RegisterType. Once you've
initiated testing on an extension using TestType, you can use DescribeType to monitor the
current test status and test status description for the extension. An extension must have a
test status of PASSED before it can be published. For more information, see Publishing
extensions to make them available for public use in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

    update_stack(stack_name)
    update_stack(stack_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the
stack update starts. You can check the status of the stack through the DescribeStacks
action. To get a copy of the template for an existing stack, you can use the GetTemplate
action. For more information about creating an update template, updating a stack, and
monitoring the progress of the update, see Updating a Stack.

# Arguments
- `stack_name`: The name or unique stack ID of the stack to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
  contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to update the stack.
  CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that
  can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly
  acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources
  require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If
  you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with
  custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these
  capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack
  template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated
  with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey
  AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role
   AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see
  Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some
  template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include
  simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations
  of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the
  processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before
  actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you
  choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the
  resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the
  AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If
  you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks,
  you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should
  only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what
  processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function
  for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the
  function operation without CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using
  CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for this UpdateStack request. Specify this
  token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting
  to update a stack with the same name. You might retry UpdateStack requests to ensure that
  CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given stack operation
  are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For
  example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the
  StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the
  console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
  operations that are initiated from the console use the token format
  Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For
  example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the
  same token in the following format:
  Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
- `"DisableRollback"`: Preserve the state of previously provisioned resources when an
  operation fails. Default: False
- `"NotificationARNs"`: Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names
  (ARNs) that CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to remove all
  notification topics.
- `"Parameters"`: A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
  stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
- `"ResourceTypes"`: The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for
  this update stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or
  Custom::MyCustomInstance. If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that
  you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to
  all resource types. Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for
  CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see
  Controlling Access with Identity and Access Management.
- `"RoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  role that CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's
  credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all
  future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the
  stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it.
  Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation
  uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
  CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.
- `"RollbackConfiguration"`: The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during
  stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
- `"StackPolicyBody"`: Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either
  the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both. You might update the
  stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a
  stack update. If you don't specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated
  with the stack is unchanged.
- `"StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody"`: Structure containing the temporary overriding stack
  policy body. You can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the
  StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both. If you want to update protected
  resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you don't
  specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used.
- `"StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL"`: Location of a file containing the temporary overriding
  stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in
  the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the
  StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both. If you want to update protected
  resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you don't
  specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used.
- `"StackPolicyURL"`: Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must
  point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack.
  You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.
  You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you
  created during a stack update. If you don't specify a stack policy, the current policy that
  is associated with the stack is unchanged.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates
  these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum number of 50
  tags. If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags.
  If you specify an empty value, CloudFormation removes all associated tags.
- `"TemplateBody"`: Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte
  and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. (For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the
  CloudFormation User Guide.) Conditional: You must specify only one of the following
  parameters: TemplateBody, TemplateURL, or set the UsePreviousTemplate to true.
- `"TemplateURL"`: Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a
  template that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. For more
  information, go to Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must
  specify only one of the following parameters: TemplateBody, TemplateURL, or set the
  UsePreviousTemplate to true.

    update_stack_instances(regions, stack_set_name)
    update_stack_instances(regions, stack_set_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates the parameter values for stack instances for the specified accounts, within the
specified Amazon Web Services Regions. A stack instance refers to a stack in a specific
account and Region. You can only update stack instances in Amazon Web Services Regions and
accounts where they already exist; to create additional stack instances, use
CreateStackInstances. During stack set updates, any parameters overridden for a stack
instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only update the
parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself,
use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template,
before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use
UpdateStackSet to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value
specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter,
you can then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances.

# Arguments
- `regions`: The names of one or more Amazon Web Services Regions in which you want to
  update parameter values for stack instances. The overridden parameter values will be
  applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions.
- `stack_set_name`: The name or unique ID of the stack set associated with the stack
  instances.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Accounts"`: [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more Amazon Web Services
  accounts for which you want to update parameter values for stack instances. The overridden
  parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and
  Amazon Web Services Regions. You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not both.
- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   If you are
  signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your Amazon Web
  Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account.
  For more information, see Register a delegated administrator in the CloudFormation User
  Guide.
- `"DeploymentTargets"`: [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts for which
  you want to update parameter values for stack instances. If your update targets OUs, the
  overridden parameter values only apply to the accounts that are currently in the target OUs
  and their child OUs. Accounts added to the target OUs and their child OUs in the future
  won't use the overridden values. You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not
  both.
- `"OperationId"`: The unique identifier for this stack set operation. The operation ID
  also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that CloudFormation performs the stack
  set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry
  stack set operation requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. If
  you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.
- `"OperationPreferences"`: Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this stack set
  operation.
- `"ParameterOverrides"`: A list of input parameters whose values you want to update for
  the specified stack instances. Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack
  instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. When specifying
  parameters and their values, be aware of how CloudFormation sets parameter values during
  stack instance update operations:   To override the current value for a parameter, include
  the parameter and specify its value.   To leave an overridden parameter set to its present
  value, include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You can't specify both
  a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)   To set an overridden parameter back to the
  value specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but don't include the parameter
  in the list.   To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify this
  property at all.   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack
  instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the
  parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself,
  use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template,
  before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use
  UpdateStackSet to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value
  specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter,
  you can then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances.

"""
    update_stack_set(stack_set_name)
    update_stack_set(stack_set_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates the stack set, and associated stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon
Web Services Regions. Even if the stack set operation created by updating the stack set
fails (completely or partially, below or above a specified failure tolerance), the stack
set is updated with your changes. Subsequent CreateStackInstances calls on the specified
stack set use the updated stack set.

# Arguments
- `stack_set_name`: The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Accounts"`: [Self-managed permissions] The accounts in which to update associated stack
  instances. If you specify accounts, you must also specify the Amazon Web Services Regions
  in which to update stack set instances. To update all the stack instances associated with
  this stack set, don't specify the Accounts or Regions properties. If the stack set update
  includes changes to the template (that is, if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties
  are specified), or the Parameters property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a
  status of OUTDATED prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and
  Amazon Web Services Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the
  template or parameters, CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified
  accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with
  their existing stack instance status.
- `"AdministrationRoleARN"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to use to
  update this stack set. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator
  roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same
  administrator account. For more information, see Granting Permissions for Stack Set
  Operations in the CloudFormation User Guide. If you specified a customized administrator
  role when you created the stack set, you must specify a customized administrator role, even
  if it is the same customized administrator role used with this stack set previously.
- `"AutoDeployment"`: [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets
  automatically deploys to Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization or
  organizational unit (OU). If you specify AutoDeployment, don't specify DeploymentTargets or
  Regions.
- `"CallAs"`: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account
  administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
  member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed
  permissions.   If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   If you are
  signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your Amazon Web
  Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account.
  For more information, see Register a delegated administrator in the CloudFormation User
  Guide.
- `"Capabilities"`: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
  contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to update the stack set and its
  associated stack instances.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack
  templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services
  account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those
  stacks sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.
  The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either
  capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation
  returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these
  resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
  permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group
  AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User
   AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in
  CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some templates reference macros. If
  your stack set template references one or more macros, you must update the stack set
  directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a
  change set. To update the stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For
  more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on
  Templates.  Stack sets with service-managed permissions do not currently support the use of
  macros in templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which
  are macros hosted by CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability for a stack set
  with service-managed permissions, if you reference a macro in your template the stack set
  operation will fail.
- `"DeploymentTargets"`: [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts in which
  to update associated stack instances. To update all the stack instances associated with
  this stack set, do not specify DeploymentTargets or Regions. If the stack set update
  includes changes to the template (that is, if TemplateBody or TemplateURL is specified), or
  the Parameters, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED prior to
  updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. If
  the stack set update doesn't include changes to the template or parameters, CloudFormation
  updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other
  stack instances with their existing stack instance status.
- `"Description"`: A brief description of updates that you are making.
- `"ExecutionRoleName"`: The name of the IAM execution role to use to update the stack set.
  If you do not specify an execution role, CloudFormation uses the
  AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM
  role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources
  users and groups can include in their stack sets. If you specify a customized execution
  role, CloudFormation uses that role to update the stack. If you do not specify a customized
  execution role, CloudFormation performs the update using the role previously associated
  with the stack set, so long as you have permissions to perform operations on the stack set.
- `"ManagedExecution"`: Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations
  concurrently and queues conflicting operations.
- `"OperationId"`: The unique ID for this stack set operation. The operation ID also
  functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that CloudFormation performs the stack set
  operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack
  set operation requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. If you
  don't specify an operation ID, CloudFormation generates one automatically. Repeating this
  stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is
  OUTDATED.
- `"OperationPreferences"`: Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this stack set
  operation.
- `"Parameters"`: A list of input parameters for the stack set template.
- `"PermissionModel"`: Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are
  created. You cannot modify PermissionModel if there are stack instances associated with
  your stack set.   With self-managed permissions, you must create the administrator and
  execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see Grant
  Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions.   With service-managed permissions, StackSets
  automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by
  Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed Stack Set Permissions.
- `"Regions"`: The Amazon Web Services Regions in which to update associated stack
  instances. If you specify Regions, you must also specify accounts in which to update stack
  set instances. To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not
  specify the Accounts or Regions properties. If the stack set update includes changes to the
  template (that is, if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the
  Parameters property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED
  prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack
  set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, CloudFormation updates
  the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack
  instances with their existing stack instance status.
- `"Tags"`: The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created
  from it. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created
  in the stacks. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags. If you specify tags for this
  parameter, those tags replace any list of tags that are currently associated with this
  stack set. This means:   If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn't modify
  the stack's tags.   If you specify any tags using this parameter, you must specify all the
  tags that you want associated with this stack set, even tags you've specified before (for
  example, when creating the stack set or during a previous update of the stack set.). Any
  tags that you don't include in the updated list of tags are removed from the stack set, and
  therefore from the stacks and resources as well.   If you specify an empty value,
  CloudFormation removes all currently associated tags.   If you specify new tags as part of
  an UpdateStackSet action, CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM
  permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the stack
  set from the list of tags you specify, CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those
  tags from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources. If
  you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire UpdateStackSet action fails with an
  access denied error, and the stack set is not updated.
- `"TemplateBody"`: The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length of
  1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, see Template Anatomy in
  the CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following
  parameters: TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.
- `"TemplateURL"`: The location of the file that contains the template body. The URL must
  point to a template (maximum size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket or
  a Systems Manager document. For more information, see Template Anatomy in the
  CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following
  parameters: TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.
- `"UsePreviousTemplate"`: Use the existing template that's associated with the stack set
  that you're updating. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
  TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.
