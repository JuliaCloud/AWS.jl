    AddTagsToResource()

Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin, SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or Test. Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.  We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters.  For more information about using tags with EC2 instances, see Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `ResourceId`: The resource ID you want to tag. Use the ID of the resource. Here are some examples: ManagedInstance: mi-012345abcde MaintenanceWindow: mw-012345abcde PatchBaseline: pb-012345abcde For the Document and Parameter values, use the name of the resource.  The ManagedInstance type for this API action is only for on-premises managed instances. You must specify the name of the managed instance in the following format: mi-ID_number. For example, mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f. 
- `ResourceType`: Specifies the type of resource you are tagging.  The ManagedInstance type for this API action is for on-premises managed instances. You must specify the name of the managed instance in the following format: mi-ID_number. For example, mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f. 
- `Tags`:  One or more tags. The value parameter is required, but if you don't want the tag to have a value, specify the parameter with no value, and we set the value to an empty string.   Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field.

"""
    CreateActivation()

Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) with Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises instances and VMs using Systems Manager, see Setting up AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.   On-premises servers or VMs that are registered with Systems Manager and EC2 instances that you manage with Systems Manager are all called managed instances. 

# Required Parameters
- `IamRole`: The Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want to assign to the managed instance. This IAM role must provide AssumeRole permissions for the Systems Manager service principal ssm.amazonaws.com. For more information, see Create an IAM service role for a hybrid environment in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
- `DefaultInstanceName`: The name of the registered, managed instance as it will appear in the Systems Manager console or when you use the AWS command line tools to list Systems Manager resources.  Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field. 
- `Description`: A user-defined description of the resource that you want to register with Systems Manager.   Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field. 
- `ExpirationDate`: The date by which this activation request should expire. The default value is 24 hours.
- `RegistrationLimit`: Specify the maximum number of managed instances you want to register. The default value is 1 instance.
- `Tags`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an activation to identify which servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your on-premises environment you intend to activate. In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:    Key=OS,Value=Windows     Key=Environment,Value=Production     When you install SSM Agent on your on-premises servers and VMs, you specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the activation ID and code, tags assigned to the activation are automatically applied to the on-premises servers or VMs.  You can't add tags to or delete tags from an existing activation. You can tag your on-premises servers and VMs after they connect to Systems Manager for the first time and are assigned a managed instance ID. This means they are listed in the AWS Systems Manager console with an ID that is prefixed with \"mi-\". For information about how to add tags to your managed instances, see AddTagsToResource. For information about how to remove tags from your managed instances, see RemoveTagsFromResource.

"""
    CreateAssociation()

A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances. For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an AWS Resource Group or an AWS Autoscaling Group, State Manager applies the configuration when new instances are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software is not installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service is not running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service. 

# Required Parameters
- `Name`: The name of the SSM document that contains the configuration information for the instance. You can specify Command or Automation documents. You can specify AWS-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another account. For SSM documents that are shared with you from other AWS accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:  arn:partition:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name   For example:  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document  For AWS-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document.

# Optional Parameters
- `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`: By default, when you create a new associations, the system runs it immediately after it is created and then according to the schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't want an association to run immediately after you create it. This parameter is not supported for rate expressions.
- `AssociationName`: Specify a descriptive name for the association.
- `AutomationTargetParameterName`: Specify the target for the association. This target is required for associations that use an Automation document and target resources by using rate controls.
- `ComplianceSeverity`: The severity level to assign to the association.
- `DocumentVersion`: The document version you want to associate with the target(s). Can be a specific version or the default version.
- `InstanceId`: The instance ID.   InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify an instance ID for an association, use the Targets parameter. Requests that include the parameter InstanceID with SSM documents that use schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if you use the parameter InstanceId, you cannot use the parameters AssociationName, DocumentVersion, MaxErrors, MaxConcurrency, OutputLocation, or ScheduleExpression. To use these parameters, you must use the Targets parameter. 
- `MaxConcurrency`: The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time. If a new instance starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new instance will process its association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
- `MaxErrors`: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 instances and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.
- `OutputLocation`: An S3 bucket where you want to store the output details of the request.
- `Parameters`: The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.
- `ScheduleExpression`: A cron expression when the association will be applied to the target(s).
- `SyncCompliance`: The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parameter for the PutComplianceItems API action. In this case, compliance data is not managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API action. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.
- `Targets`: The targets for the association. You can target instances by using tags, AWS Resource Groups, all instances in an AWS account, or individual instance IDs. For more information about choosing targets for an association, see Using targets and rate controls with State Manager associations in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

For more information about SSM documents, including information about supported schemas, features, and syntax, see AWS Systems Manager Documents in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `Content`: The content for the new SSM document in JSON or YAML format. We recommend storing the contents for your new document in an external JSON or YAML file and referencing the file in a command. For examples, see the following topics in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.    Create an SSM document (AWS API)     Create an SSM document (AWS CLI)     Create an SSM document (API)   
- `Name`: A name for the Systems Manager document.  You can't use the following strings as document name prefixes. These are reserved by AWS for use as document name prefixes:    aws-     amazon     amzn    

# Optional Parameters
- `Attachments`: A list of key and value pairs that describe attachments to a version of a document.
- `DocumentFormat`: Specify the document format for the request. The document format can be JSON, YAML, or TEXT. JSON is the default format.
- `DocumentType`: The type of document to create.
- `Requires`: A list of SSM documents required by a document. This parameter is used exclusively by AWS AppConfig. When a user creates an AppConfig configuration in an SSM document, the user must also specify a required document for validation purposes. In this case, an ApplicationConfiguration document requires an ApplicationConfigurationSchema document for validation purposes. For more information, see AWS AppConfig in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `Tags`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an SSM document to identify the types of targets or the environment where it will run. In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:    Key=OS,Value=Windows     Key=Environment,Value=Production     To add tags to an existing SSM document, use the AddTagsToResource action. 
- `TargetType`: Specify a target type to define the kinds of resources the document can run on. For example, to run a document on EC2 instances, specify the following value: /AWS::EC2::Instance. If you specify a value of '/' the document can run on all types of resources. If you don't specify a value, the document can't run on any resources. For a list of valid resource types, see AWS resource and property types reference in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. 
- `VersionName`: An optional field specifying the version of the artifact you are creating with the document. For example, \"Release 12, Update 6\". This value is unique across all versions of a document, and cannot be changed.

    CreateMaintenanceWindow()

Creates a new maintenance window.  The value you specify for Duration determines the specific end time for the maintenance window based on the time it begins. No maintenance window tasks are permitted to start after the resulting endtime minus the number of hours you specify for Cutoff. For example, if the maintenance window starts at 3 PM, the duration is three hours, and the value you specify for Cutoff is one hour, no maintenance window tasks can start after 5 PM. 

# Required Parameters
- `AllowUnassociatedTargets`: Enables a maintenance window task to run on managed instances, even if you have not registered those instances as targets. If enabled, then you must specify the unregistered instances (by instance ID) when you register a task with the maintenance window. If you don't enable this option, then you must specify previously-registered targets when you register a task with the maintenance window.
- `Cutoff`: The number of hours before the end of the maintenance window that Systems Manager stops scheduling new tasks for execution.
- `Duration`: The duration of the maintenance window in hours.
- `Name`: The name of the maintenance window.
- `Schedule`: The schedule of the maintenance window in the form of a cron or rate expression.

# Optional Parameters
- `ClientToken`: User-provided idempotency token.
- `Description`: An optional description for the maintenance window. We recommend specifying a description to help you organize your maintenance windows. 
- `EndDate`: The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the maintenance window to become inactive. EndDate allows you to set a date and time in the future when the maintenance window will no longer run.
- `ScheduleOffset`: The number of days to wait after the date and time specified by a CRON expression before running the maintenance window. For example, the following cron expression schedules a maintenance window to run on the third Tuesday of every month at 11:30 PM.  cron(0 30 23 ? * TUE#3 *)  If the schedule offset is 2, the maintenance window won't run until two days later.
- `ScheduleTimezone`: The time zone that the scheduled maintenance window executions are based on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format. For example: \"America/Los_Angeles\", \"etc/UTC\", or \"Asia/Seoul\". For more information, see the Time Zone Database on the IANA website.
- `StartDate`: The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the maintenance window to become active. StartDate allows you to delay activation of the maintenance window until the specified future date.
- `Tags`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a maintenance window to identify the type of tasks it will run, the types of targets, and the environment it will run in. In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:    Key=TaskType,Value=AgentUpdate     Key=OS,Value=Windows     Key=Environment,Value=Production     To add tags to an existing maintenance window, use the AddTagsToResource action.

    CreateResourceDataSync()

A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: SyncToDestination and SyncFromSource. You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the SyncToDestination type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple AWS Regions to a single S3 bucket. For more information, see Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the SyncFromSource type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple AWS Regions to a single S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple AWS accounts and Regions or EntireOrganization by using AWS Organizations. For more information, see Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the ListResourceDataSync.  By default, data is not encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy.  

# Required Parameters
- `SyncName`: A name for the configuration.

# Optional Parameters
- `S3Destination`: Amazon S3 configuration details for the sync. This parameter is required if the SyncType value is SyncToDestination.
- `SyncSource`: Specify information about the data sources to synchronize. This parameter is required if the SyncType value is SyncFromSource.
- `SyncType`: Specify SyncToDestination to create a resource data sync that synchronizes data to an S3 bucket for Inventory. If you specify SyncToDestination, you must provide a value for S3Destination.

To change the configuration state of an instance after you disassociate a document, you must create a new document with the desired configuration and associate it with the instance.

# Optional Parameters
- `AssociationId`: The association ID that you want to delete.
- `InstanceId`: The ID of the instance.
- `Name`: The name of the Systems Manager document.

    DeleteDocument()

Deletes the Systems Manager document and all instance associations to the document. Before you delete the document, we recommend that you use DeleteAssociation to disassociate all instances that are associated with the document.

# Required Parameters
- `Name`: The name of the document.

# Optional Parameters
- `DocumentVersion`: The version of the document that you want to delete. If not provided, all versions of the document are deleted.
- `Force`: Some SSM document types require that you specify a Force flag before you can delete the document. For example, you must specify a Force flag to delete a document of type ApplicationConfigurationSchema. You can restrict access to the Force flag in an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy.
- `VersionName`: The version name of the document that you want to delete. If not provided, all versions of the document are deleted.

    DeleteInventory()

Delete a custom inventory type or the data associated with a custom Inventory type. Deleting a custom inventory type is also referred to as deleting a custom inventory schema.

# Required Parameters
- `TypeName`: The name of the custom inventory type for which you want to delete either all previously collected data or the inventory type itself. 

# Optional Parameters
- `ClientToken`: User-provided idempotency token.
- `DryRun`: Use this option to view a summary of the deletion request without deleting any data or the data type. This option is useful when you only want to understand what will be deleted. Once you validate that the data to be deleted is what you intend to delete, you can run the same command without specifying the DryRun option.
- `SchemaDeleteOption`: Use the SchemaDeleteOption to delete a custom inventory type (schema). If you don't choose this option, the system only deletes existing inventory data associated with the custom inventory type. Choose one of the following options: DisableSchema: If you choose this option, the system ignores all inventory data for the specified version, and any earlier versions. To enable this schema again, you must call the PutInventory action for a version greater than the disabled version. DeleteSchema: This option deletes the specified custom type from the Inventory service. You can recreate the schema later, if you want.

    GetServiceSetting()

 ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an AWS service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an AWS service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the AWS service team might create a default setting of \"false\". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to \"true\" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature. Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. AWS services teams define the default value for a SettingId. You can't create a new SettingId, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the UpdateServiceSetting API action to change the default setting. Or use the ResetServiceSetting to change the value back to the original value defined by the AWS service team. Query the current service setting for the account. 

# Required Parameters

    LabelParameterVersion()

A parameter label is a user-defined alias to help you manage different versions of a parameter. When you modify a parameter, Systems Manager automatically saves a new version and increments the version number by one. A label can help you remember the purpose of a parameter when there are multiple versions.  Parameter labels have the following requirements and restrictions.   A version of a parameter can have a maximum of 10 labels.   You can't attach the same label to different versions of the same parameter. For example, if version 1 has the label Production, then you can't attach Production to version 2.   You can move a label from one version of a parameter to another.   You can't create a label when you create a new parameter. You must attach a label to a specific version of a parameter.   You can't delete a parameter label. If you no longer want to use a parameter label, then you must move it to a different version of a parameter.   A label can have a maximum of 100 characters.   Labels can contain letters (case sensitive), numbers, periods (.), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).   Labels can't begin with a number, \"aws,\" or \"ssm\" (not case sensitive). If a label fails to meet these requirements, then the label is not associated with a parameter and the system displays it in the list of InvalidLabels.  

# Required Parameters
- `Labels`: One or more labels to attach to the specified parameter version.
- `Name`: The parameter name on which you want to attach one or more labels.

"""
    PutParameter()

Add a parameter to the system.

# Required Parameters
- `Name`: The fully qualified name of the parameter that you want to add to the system. The fully qualified name includes the complete hierarchy of the parameter path and name. For parameters in a hierarchy, you must include a leading forward slash character (/) when you create or reference a parameter. For example: /Dev/DBServer/MySQL/db-string13  Naming Constraints:   Parameter names are case sensitive.   A parameter name must be unique within an AWS Region   A parameter name can't be prefixed with \"aws\" or \"ssm\" (case-insensitive).   Parameter names can include only the following symbols and letters: a-zA-Z0-9_.-/    A parameter name can't include spaces.   Parameter hierarchies are limited to a maximum depth of fifteen levels.   For additional information about valid values for parameter names, see About requirements and constraints for parameter names in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.  The maximum length constraint listed below includes capacity for additional system attributes that are not part of the name. The maximum length for a parameter name, including the full length of the parameter ARN, is 1011 characters. For example, the length of the following parameter name is 65 characters, not 20 characters:  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:parameter/ExampleParameterName  
- `Value`: The parameter value that you want to add to the system. Standard parameters have a value limit of 4 KB. Advanced parameters have a value limit of 8 KB.  Parameters can't be referenced or nested in the values of other parameters. You can't include {{}} or {{ssm:parameter-name}} in a parameter value. 

# Optional Parameters
- `AllowedPattern`: A regular expression used to validate the parameter value. For example, for String types with values restricted to numbers, you can specify the following: AllowedPattern=^d+ 
- `DataType`: The data type for a String parameter. Supported data types include plain text and Amazon Machine Image IDs.  The following data type values are supported.     text     aws:ec2:image    When you create a String parameter and specify aws:ec2:image, Systems Manager validates the parameter value is in the required format, such as ami-12345abcdeEXAMPLE, and that the specified AMI is available in your AWS account. For more information, see Native parameter support for Amazon Machine Image IDs in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `Description`: Information about the parameter that you want to add to the system. Optional but recommended.  Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field. 
- `KeyId`: The KMS Key ID that you want to use to encrypt a parameter. Either the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key automatically assigned to your AWS account or a custom key. Required for parameters that use the SecureString data type. If you don't specify a key ID, the system uses the default key associated with your AWS account.   To use your default AWS KMS key, choose the SecureString data type, and do not specify the Key ID when you create the parameter. The system automatically populates Key ID with your default KMS key.   To use a custom KMS key, choose the SecureString data type with the Key ID parameter.  
- `Overwrite`: Overwrite an existing parameter. If not specified, will default to \"false\".
- `Policies`: One or more policies to apply to a parameter. This action takes a JSON array. Parameter Store supports the following policy types: Expiration: This policy deletes the parameter after it expires. When you create the policy, you specify the expiration date. You can update the expiration date and time by updating the policy. Updating the parameter does not affect the expiration date and time. When the expiration time is reached, Parameter Store deletes the parameter. ExpirationNotification: This policy triggers an event in Amazon CloudWatch Events that notifies you about the expiration. By using this policy, you can receive notification before or after the expiration time is reached, in units of days or hours. NoChangeNotification: This policy triggers a CloudWatch event if a parameter has not been modified for a specified period of time. This policy type is useful when, for example, a secret needs to be changed within a period of time, but it has not been changed. All existing policies are preserved until you send new policies or an empty policy. For more information about parameter policies, see Assigning parameter policies. 
- `Tags`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a Systems Manager parameter to identify the type of resource to which it applies, the environment, or the type of configuration data referenced by the parameter. In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:    Key=Resource,Value=S3bucket     Key=OS,Value=Windows     Key=ParameterType,Value=LicenseKey     To add tags to an existing Systems Manager parameter, use the AddTagsToResource action. 
- `Tier`: The parameter tier to assign to a parameter. Parameter Store offers a standard tier and an advanced tier for parameters. Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB and can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 10,000 standard parameters for each Region in an AWS account. Standard parameters are offered at no additional cost.  Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced parameters for each Region in an AWS account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more information, see Standard and advanced parameter tiers in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time. But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters.  If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard parameter.   Using the Default Tier Configuration  In PutParameter requests, you can specify the tier to create the parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request, Parameter Store creates or updates the parameter according to that request. However, if you do not specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier configuration. The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the following as the default:    Advanced: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as advanced parameters.     Intelligent-Tiering: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced.  If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier. This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary.    Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:   The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.   The parameter uses a parameter policy.   More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your AWS account in the current Region.   For more information about configuring the default tier option, see Specifying a default parameter tier in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `Type`: The type of parameter that you want to add to the system.   SecureString is not currently supported for AWS CloudFormation templates.  Items in a StringList must be separated by a comma (,). You can't use other punctuation or special character to escape items in the list. If you have a parameter value that requires a comma, then use the String data type.  Specifying a parameter type is not required when updating a parameter. You must specify a parameter type when creating a parameter.

    ResetServiceSetting()

 ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an AWS service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an AWS service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the AWS service team might create a default setting of \"false\". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to \"true\" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature. Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. AWS services teams define the default value for a SettingId. You can't create a new SettingId, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the GetServiceSetting API action to view the current value. Use the UpdateServiceSetting API action to change the default setting.

- `Comment`: User-specified information about the command, such as a brief description of what the command should do.
- `DocumentHash`: The Sha256 or Sha1 hash created by the system when the document was created.   Sha1 hashes have been deprecated. 
- `DocumentHashType`: Sha256 or Sha1.  Sha1 hashes have been deprecated. 
- `DocumentVersion`: The SSM document version to use in the request. You can specify DEFAULT, LATEST, or a specific version number. If you run commands by using the AWS CLI, then you must escape the first two options by using a backslash. If you specify a version number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For example: --document-version \"DEFAULT\" --document-version \"LATEST\" --document-version \"3\"
- `InstanceIds`: The IDs of the instances where the command should run. Specifying instance IDs is most useful when you are targeting a limited number of instances, though you can specify up to 50 IDs. To target a larger number of instances, or if you prefer not to list individual instance IDs, we recommend using the Targets option instead. Using Targets, which accepts tag key-value pairs to identify the instances to send commands to, you can a send command to tens, hundreds, or thousands of instances at once. For more information about how to use targets, see Using targets and rate controls to send commands to a fleet in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `MaxConcurrency`: (Optional) The maximum number of instances that are allowed to run the command at the same time. You can specify a number such as 10 or a percentage such as 10%. The default value is 50. For more information about how to use MaxConcurrency, see Using concurrency controls in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `MaxErrors`: The maximum number of errors allowed without the command failing. When the command fails one more time beyond the value of MaxErrors, the systems stops sending the command to additional targets. You can specify a number like 10 or a percentage like 10%. The default value is 0. For more information about how to use MaxErrors, see Using error controls in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `NotificationConfig`: Configurations for sending notifications.
- `OutputS3BucketName`: The name of the S3 bucket where command execution responses should be stored.

    UpdateAssociation()

Updates an association. You can update the association name and version, the document version, schedule, parameters, and Amazon S3 output.  In order to call this API action, your IAM user account, group, or role must be configured with permission to call the DescribeAssociation API action. If you don't have permission to call DescribeAssociation, then you receive the following error: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the UpdateAssociation operation: User: &lt;user_arn&gt; is not authorized to perform: ssm:DescribeAssociation on resource: &lt;resource_arn&gt;   When you update an association, the association immediately runs against the specified targets. 

# Required Parameters
- `AssociationId`: The ID of the association you want to update. 

# Optional Parameters
- `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`: By default, when you update an association, the system runs it immediately after it is updated and then according to the schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't want an association to run immediately after you update it. This parameter is not supported for rate expressions. Also, if you specified this option when you created the association, you can reset it. To do so, specify the no-apply-only-at-cron-interval parameter when you update the association from the command line. This parameter forces the association to run immediately after updating it and according to the interval specified.
- `AssociationName`: The name of the association that you want to update.
- `AssociationVersion`: This parameter is provided for concurrency control purposes. You must specify the latest association version in the service. If you want to ensure that this request succeeds, either specify LATEST, or omit this parameter.
- `AutomationTargetParameterName`: Specify the target for the association. This target is required for associations that use an Automation document and target resources by using rate controls.
- `ComplianceSeverity`: The severity level to assign to the association.
- `DocumentVersion`: The document version you want update for the association. 
- `MaxConcurrency`: The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time. If a new instance starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new instance will process its association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
- `MaxErrors`: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 instances and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.
- `Name`: The name of the SSM document that contains the configuration information for the instance. You can specify Command or Automation documents. You can specify AWS-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another account. For SSM documents that are shared with you from other AWS accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:  arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name   For example:  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document  For AWS-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document.
- `OutputLocation`: An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.
- `Parameters`: The parameters you want to update for the association. If you create a parameter using Parameter Store, you can reference the parameter using {{ssm:parameter-name}}
- `ScheduleExpression`: The cron expression used to schedule the association that you want to update.
- `SyncCompliance`: The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parameter for the PutComplianceItems API action. In this case, compliance data is not managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API action. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.
- `Targets`: The targets of the association.
