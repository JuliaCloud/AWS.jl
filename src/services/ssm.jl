    GetParameter()

    LabelParameterVersion()

A parameter label is a user-defined alias to help you manage different versions of a parameter. When you modify a parameter, Systems Manager automatically saves a new version and increments the version number by one. A label can help you remember the purpose of a parameter when there are multiple versions.  Parameter labels have the following requirements and restrictions.   A version of a parameter can have a maximum of 10 labels.   You can't attach the same label to different versions of the same parameter. For example, if version 1 has the label Production, then you can't attach Production to version 2.   You can move a label from one version of a parameter to another.   You can't create a label when you create a new parameter. You must attach a label to a specific version of a parameter.   You can't delete a parameter label. If you no longer want to use a parameter label, then you must move it to a different version of a parameter.   A label can have a maximum of 100 characters.   Labels can contain letters (case sensitive), numbers, periods (.), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).   Labels can't begin with a number, "aws," or "ssm" (not case sensitive). If a label fails to meet these requirements, then the label is not associated with a parameter and the system displays it in the list of InvalidLabels.  

Required Parameters
{
  "Labels": "One or more labels to attach to the specified parameter version.",
  "Name": "The parameter name on which you want to attach one or more labels."

    AddTagsToResource()

Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin, SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or Test. Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.  We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon EC2 and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters.  For more information about tags, see Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

    CreateResourceDataSync()

A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: SyncToDestination and SyncFromSource. You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the SyncToDestination type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple AWS Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the SyncFromSource type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple AWS Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple AWS accounts and Regions or EntireOrganization by using AWS Organizations. For more information, see Setting Up Explorer to Display Data from Multiple Accounts and Regions in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the ListResourceDataSync.  By default, data is not encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy.  

Required Parameters

  "Tier": "The parameter tier to assign to a parameter. Parameter Store offers a standard tier and an advanced tier for parameters. Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB and can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 10,000 standard parameters for each Region in an AWS account. Standard parameters are offered at no additional cost.  Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced parameters for each Region in an AWS account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more information, see About Advanced Parameters in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time. But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters.  If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard parameter.   Using the Default Tier Configuration  In PutParameter requests, you can specify the tier to create the parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request, Parameter Store creates or updates the parameter according to that request. However, if you do not specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier configuration. The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the following as the default:    Advanced: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as advanced parameters.     Intelligent-Tiering: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced.  If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier. This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary.    Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:   The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.   The parameter uses a parameter policy.   More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your AWS account in the current Region.
