    add_tags_to_resource(resource_id, resource_type, tags)
    add_tags_to_resource(resource_id, resource_type, tags, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you
can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store
parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different
ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for
your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack
level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin, SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and
Value=Production, Pre-Production, or Test. Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.  We
recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type.
Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You
can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic
meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters.  For more information
about using tags with EC2 instances, see Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon
EC2 User Guide.

# Arguments
- `resource_id`: The resource ID you want to tag. Use the ID of the resource. Here are some
  examples: ManagedInstance: mi-012345abcde MaintenanceWindow: mw-012345abcde PatchBaseline:
  pb-012345abcde For the Document and Parameter values, use the name of the resource.  The
  ManagedInstance type for this API action is only for on-premises managed instances. You
  must specify the name of the managed instance in the following format: mi-ID_number. For
  example, mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f.
- `resource_type`: Specifies the type of resource you are tagging.  The ManagedInstance
  type for this API action is for on-premises managed instances. You must specify the name of
  the managed instance in the following format: mi-ID_number. For example, mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f.
- `tags`:  One or more tags. The value parameter is required, but if you don't want the tag
  to have a value, specify the parameter with no value, and we set the value to an empty
  string.   Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field.

    create_activation(iam_role)
    create_activation(iam_role, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises
server or virtual machine (VM) with Systems Manager. Registering these machines with
Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You
use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid
environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises instances and
VMs using Systems Manager, see Setting up AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments in
the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.   On-premises servers or VMs that are registered with
Systems Manager and EC2 instances that you manage with Systems Manager are all called
managed instances.

# Arguments
- `iam_role`: The Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want to assign
  to the managed instance. This IAM role must provide AssumeRole permissions for the Systems
  Manager service principal ssm.amazonaws.com. For more information, see Create an IAM
  service role for a hybrid environment in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DefaultInstanceName"`: The name of the registered, managed instance as it will appear
  in the Systems Manager console or when you use the AWS command line tools to list Systems
  Manager resources.  Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field.
- `"Description"`: A user-defined description of the resource that you want to register
  with Systems Manager.   Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field.
- `"ExpirationDate"`: The date by which this activation request should expire. The default
  value is 24 hours.
- `"RegistrationLimit"`: Specify the maximum number of managed instances you want to
  register. The default value is 1 instance.
- `"Tags"`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize
  a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you
  might want to tag an activation to identify which servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your
  on-premises environment you intend to activate. In this case, you could specify the
  following key name/value pairs:    Key=OS,Value=Windows
  Key=Environment,Value=Production     When you install SSM Agent on your on-premises servers
  and VMs, you specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the activation ID and
  code, tags assigned to the activation are automatically applied to the on-premises servers
  or VMs.  You can't add tags to or delete tags from an existing activation. You can tag your
  on-premises servers and VMs after they connect to Systems Manager for the first time and
  are assigned a managed instance ID. This means they are listed in the AWS Systems Manager
  console with an ID that is prefixed with \"mi-\". For information about how to add tags to
  your managed instances, see AddTagsToResource. For information about how to remove tags
  from your managed instances, see RemoveTagsFromResource.

"""
    create_association(name)
    create_association(name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances.
For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and
running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the
association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic
targets, such as an AWS Resource Group or an AWS Autoscaling Group, State Manager applies
the configuration when new instances are added to the group. The association also specifies
actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus
software might run once a day. If the software is not installed, then State Manager
installs it. If the software is installed, but the service is not running, then the
association might instruct State Manager to start the service.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the SSM document that contains the configuration information for the
  instance. You can specify Command or Automation documents. You can specify AWS-predefined
  documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another
  account. For SSM documents that are shared with you from other AWS accounts, you must
  specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:
  arn:partition:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name   For example:
  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document  For AWS-predefined documents
  and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name.
  For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval"`: By default, when you create a new associations, the system
  runs it immediately after it is created and then according to the schedule you specified.
  Specify this option if you don't want an association to run immediately after you create
  it. This parameter is not supported for rate expressions.
- `"AssociationName"`: Specify a descriptive name for the association.
- `"AutomationTargetParameterName"`: Specify the target for the association. This target is
  required for associations that use an Automation document and target resources by using
  rate controls.
- `"ComplianceSeverity"`: The severity level to assign to the association.
- `"DocumentVersion"`: The document version you want to associate with the target(s). Can
  be a specific version or the default version.
- `"InstanceId"`: The instance ID.   InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify an instance
  ID for an association, use the Targets parameter. Requests that include the parameter
  InstanceID with SSM documents that use schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition,
  if you use the parameter InstanceId, you cannot use the parameters AssociationName,
  DocumentVersion, MaxErrors, MaxConcurrency, OutputLocation, or ScheduleExpression. To use
  these parameters, you must use the Targets parameter.
- `"MaxConcurrency"`: The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the
  same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for
  example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the
  same time. If a new instance starts and attempts to run an association while Systems
  Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During
  the next association interval, the new instance will process its association within the
  limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
- `"MaxErrors"`: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending
  requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute
  number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If
  you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is
  received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is
  returned. If you run an association on 50 instances and set MaxError to 10%, then the
  system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are
  already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some
  of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than
  max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a
  time.
- `"OutputLocation"`: An S3 bucket where you want to store the output details of the
  request.
- `"Parameters"`: The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.
- `"ScheduleExpression"`: A cron expression when the association will be applied to the
  target(s).
- `"SyncCompliance"`: The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO
  or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to
  determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the
  association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the
  association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a
  parameter for the PutComplianceItems API action. In this case, compliance data is not
  managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API
  action. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.
- `"TargetLocations"`: A location is a combination of AWS Regions and AWS accounts where
  you want to run the association. Use this action to create an association in multiple
  Regions and multiple accounts.
- `"Targets"`: The targets for the association. You can target instances by using tags, AWS
  Resource Groups, all instances in an AWS account, or individual instance IDs. For more
  information about choosing targets for an association, see Using targets and rate controls
  with State Manager associations in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

Creates a Systems Manager (SSM) document. An SSM document defines the actions that Systems
Manager performs on your managed instances. For more information about SSM documents,
including information about supported schemas, features, and syntax, see AWS Systems
Manager Documents in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

# Arguments
- `content`: The content for the new SSM document in JSON or YAML format. We recommend
  storing the contents for your new document in an external JSON or YAML file and referencing
  the file in a command. For examples, see the following topics in the AWS Systems Manager
  User Guide.    Create an SSM document (AWS API)     Create an SSM document (AWS CLI)

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Attachments"`: A list of key and value pairs that describe attachments to a version of
  a document.
- `"DocumentFormat"`: Specify the document format for the request. The document format can
  be JSON, YAML, or TEXT. JSON is the default format.
- `"DocumentType"`: The type of document to create.
- `"Requires"`: A list of SSM documents required by a document. This parameter is used
  exclusively by AWS AppConfig. When a user creates an AppConfig configuration in an SSM
  document, the user must also specify a required document for validation purposes. In this
  case, an ApplicationConfiguration document requires an ApplicationConfigurationSchema
  document for validation purposes. For more information, see AWS AppConfig in the AWS
  Systems Manager User Guide.
- `"Tags"`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize
  a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you
  might want to tag an SSM document to identify the types of targets or the environment where
  it will run. In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:
  Key=OS,Value=Windows     Key=Environment,Value=Production     To add tags to an existing
  SSM document, use the AddTagsToResource action.
- `"TargetType"`: Specify a target type to define the kinds of resources the document can
  run on. For example, to run a document on EC2 instances, specify the following value:
  /AWS::EC2::Instance. If you specify a value of '/' the document can run on all types of
  resources. If you don't specify a value, the document can't run on any resources. For a
  list of valid resource types, see AWS resource and property types reference in the AWS
  CloudFormation User Guide.
- `"VersionName"`: An optional field specifying the version of the artifact you are
  creating with the document. For example, \"Release 12, Update 6\". This value is unique
  across all versions of a document, and cannot be changed.

"""
    create_maintenance_window(allow_unassociated_targets, cutoff, duration, name, schedule)
    create_maintenance_window(allow_unassociated_targets, cutoff, duration, name, schedule, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new maintenance window.  The value you specify for Duration determines the
specific end time for the maintenance window based on the time it begins. No maintenance
window tasks are permitted to start after the resulting endtime minus the number of hours
you specify for Cutoff. For example, if the maintenance window starts at 3 PM, the duration
is three hours, and the value you specify for Cutoff is one hour, no maintenance window
tasks can start after 5 PM.

# Arguments
- `allow_unassociated_targets`: Enables a maintenance window task to run on managed
  instances, even if you have not registered those instances as targets. If enabled, then you
  must specify the unregistered instances (by instance ID) when you register a task with the
  maintenance window. If you don't enable this option, then you must specify
  previously-registered targets when you register a task with the maintenance window.
- `cutoff`: The number of hours before the end of the maintenance window that Systems
  Manager stops scheduling new tasks for execution.
- `duration`: The duration of the maintenance window in hours.
- `name`: The name of the maintenance window.
- `schedule`: The schedule of the maintenance window in the form of a cron or rate
  expression.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientToken"`: User-provided idempotency token.
- `"Description"`: An optional description for the maintenance window. We recommend
  specifying a description to help you organize your maintenance windows.
- `"EndDate"`: The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the
  maintenance window to become inactive. EndDate allows you to set a date and time in the
  future when the maintenance window will no longer run.
- `"ScheduleOffset"`: The number of days to wait after the date and time specified by a
  CRON expression before running the maintenance window. For example, the following cron
  expression schedules a maintenance window to run on the third Tuesday of every month at
  11:30 PM.  cron(30 23 ? * TUE#3 *)  If the schedule offset is 2, the maintenance window
  won't run until two days later.
- `"ScheduleTimezone"`: The time zone that the scheduled maintenance window executions are
  based on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format. For example:
  \"America/Los_Angeles\", \"UTC\", or \"Asia/Seoul\". For more information, see the Time
  Zone Database on the IANA website.
- `"StartDate"`: The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the
  maintenance window to become active. StartDate allows you to delay activation of the
  maintenance window until the specified future date.
- `"Tags"`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize
  a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you
  might want to tag a maintenance window to identify the type of tasks it will run, the types

    create_resource_data_sync(sync_name)
    create_resource_data_sync(sync_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location.
Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: SyncToDestination and
SyncFromSource. You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the SyncToDestination
type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple AWS Regions to a single S3 bucket. For
more information, see Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory in the AWS Systems
Manager User Guide. You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the SyncFromSource
type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from
multiple AWS Regions to a single S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData
from multiple AWS accounts and Regions or EntireOrganization by using AWS Organizations.
For more information, see Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple
accounts and Regions in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. A resource data sync is an
asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is
completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the
ListResourceDataSync.  By default, data is not encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly
recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also
recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket
policy.

# Arguments
- `sync_name`: A name for the configuration.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"S3Destination"`: Amazon S3 configuration details for the sync. This parameter is
  required if the SyncType value is SyncToDestination.
- `"SyncSource"`: Specify information about the data sources to synchronize. This parameter
  is required if the SyncType value is SyncFromSource.
- `"SyncType"`: Specify SyncToDestination to create a resource data sync that synchronizes
  data to an S3 bucket for Inventory. If you specify SyncToDestination, you must provide a
  value for S3Destination. Specify SyncFromSource to synchronize data from a single account
  and multiple Regions, or multiple AWS accounts and Regions, as listed in AWS Organizations
  for Explorer. If you specify SyncFromSource, you must provide a value for SyncSource. The
  default value is SyncToDestination.

  associated with the custom inventory type. Choose one of the following options:
  DisableSchema: If you choose this option, the system ignores all inventory data for the
  specified version, and any earlier versions. To enable this schema again, you must call the

 ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an AWS service. This setting defines how a

service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the AWS
service team might create a default setting of \"false\". This means the user can't use
this feature unless they change the setting to \"true\" and intentionally opt in for a paid
feature. Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. AWS services teams define the
default value for a SettingId. You can't create a new SettingId, but you can overwrite the

    label_parameter_version(labels, name)
    label_parameter_version(labels, name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

A parameter label is a user-defined alias to help you manage different versions of a
parameter. When you modify a parameter, Systems Manager automatically saves a new version
and increments the version number by one. A label can help you remember the purpose of a
parameter when there are multiple versions.  Parameter labels have the following
requirements and restrictions.   A version of a parameter can have a maximum of 10 labels.
 You can't attach the same label to different versions of the same parameter. For example,
if version 1 has the label Production, then you can't attach Production to version 2.   You
can move a label from one version of a parameter to another.   You can't create a label
when you create a new parameter. You must attach a label to a specific version of a
parameter.   You can't delete a parameter label. If you no longer want to use a parameter
label, then you must move it to a different version of a parameter.   A label can have a
maximum of 100 characters.   Labels can contain letters (case sensitive), numbers, periods
(.), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).   Labels can't begin with a number, \"aws,\" or
\"ssm\" (not case sensitive). If a label fails to meet these requirements, then the label
is not associated with a parameter and the system displays it in the list of InvalidLabels.


# Arguments
- `labels`: One or more labels to attach to the specified parameter version.
- `name`: The parameter name on which you want to attach one or more labels.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ParameterVersion"`: The specific version of the parameter on which you want to attach
  one or more labels. If no version is specified, the system attaches the label to the latest

  name can't include spaces.   Parameter hierarchies are limited to a maximum depth of
  fifteen levels.   For additional information about valid values for parameter names, see
  Creating Systems Manager parameters in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.  The maximum
  length constraint listed below includes capacity for additional system attributes that are
  not part of the name. The maximum length for a parameter name, including the full length of
  the parameter ARN, is 1011 characters. For example, the length of the following parameter
  name is 65 characters, not 20 characters:
  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:parameter/ExampleParameterName
- `value`: The parameter value that you want to add to the system. Standard parameters have
  a value limit of 4 KB. Advanced parameters have a value limit of 8 KB.  Parameters can't be
  referenced or nested in the values of other parameters. You can't include {{}} or
  {{ssm:parameter-name}} in a parameter value.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AllowedPattern"`: A regular expression used to validate the parameter value. For
  example, for String types with values restricted to numbers, you can specify the following:
  AllowedPattern=^d+
- `"DataType"`: The data type for a String parameter. Supported data types include plain
  text and Amazon Machine Image IDs.  The following data type values are supported.     text
     aws:ec2:image    When you create a String parameter and specify aws:ec2:image, Systems
  Manager validates the parameter value is in the required format, such as
  ami-12345abcdeEXAMPLE, and that the specified AMI is available in your AWS account. For
  more information, see Native parameter support for Amazon Machine Image IDs in the AWS
  Systems Manager User Guide.
- `"Description"`: Information about the parameter that you want to add to the system.
  Optional but recommended.  Do not enter personally identifiable information in this field.
- `"KeyId"`: The KMS Key ID that you want to use to encrypt a parameter. Either the default
  AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key automatically assigned to your AWS account or a
  custom key. Required for parameters that use the SecureString data type. If you don't
  specify a key ID, the system uses the default key associated with your AWS account.   To
  use your default AWS KMS key, choose the SecureString data type, and do not specify the Key
  ID when you create the parameter. The system automatically populates Key ID with your
  default KMS key.   To use a custom KMS key, choose the SecureString data type with the Key
  ID parameter.
- `"Overwrite"`: Overwrite an existing parameter. If not specified, will default to
  \"false\".
- `"Policies"`: One or more policies to apply to a parameter. This action takes a JSON
  array. Parameter Store supports the following policy types: Expiration: This policy deletes
  the parameter after it expires. When you create the policy, you specify the expiration
  date. You can update the expiration date and time by updating the policy. Updating the
  parameter does not affect the expiration date and time. When the expiration time is
  reached, Parameter Store deletes the parameter. ExpirationNotification: This policy
  triggers an event in Amazon CloudWatch Events that notifies you about the expiration. By
  using this policy, you can receive notification before or after the expiration time is
  reached, in units of days or hours. NoChangeNotification: This policy triggers a CloudWatch
  event if a parameter has not been modified for a specified period of time. This policy type
  is useful when, for example, a secret needs to be changed within a period of time, but it
  has not been changed. All existing policies are preserved until you send new policies or an
  empty policy. For more information about parameter policies, see Assigning parameter
  policies.
- `"Tags"`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize
  a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you
  might want to tag a Systems Manager parameter to identify the type of resource to which it
  applies, the environment, or the type of configuration data referenced by the parameter. In
  this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:
  Key=Resource,Value=S3bucket     Key=OS,Value=Windows     Key=ParameterType,Value=LicenseKey
      To add tags to an existing Systems Manager parameter, use the AddTagsToResource action.
- `"Tier"`: The parameter tier to assign to a parameter. Parameter Store offers a standard
  tier and an advanced tier for parameters. Standard parameters have a content size limit of
  4 KB and can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 10,000
  standard parameters for each Region in an AWS account. Standard parameters are offered at
  no additional cost.  Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be
  configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced
  parameters for each Region in an AWS account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more
  information, see Standard and advanced parameter tiers in the AWS Systems Manager User
  Guide. You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time. But you can't
  revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a
  standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of
  the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the
  parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard
  parameters.  If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur
  charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard
  parameter.   Using the Default Tier Configuration  In PutParameter requests, you can
  specify the tier to create the parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request,
  Parameter Store creates or updates the parameter according to that request. However, if you
  do not specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current
  Parameter Store default tier configuration. The default tier when you begin using Parameter
  Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can
  specify one of the following as the default:    Advanced: With this option, Parameter Store
  evaluates all requests as advanced parameters.     Intelligent-Tiering: With this option,
  Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or
  advanced.  If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter,
  the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring
  an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in
  the advanced-parameter tier. This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by
  always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary.    Options
  that require an advanced parameter include the following:   The content size of the
  parameter is more than 4 KB.   The parameter uses a parameter policy.   More than 10,000
  parameters already exist in your AWS account in the current Region.   For more information
  about configuring the default tier option, see Specifying a default parameter tier in the
  AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `"Type"`: The type of parameter that you want to add to the system.   SecureString is not
  currently supported for AWS CloudFormation templates.  Items in a StringList must be
  separated by a comma (,). You can't use other punctuation or special character to escape
  items in the list. If you have a parameter value that requires a comma, then use the String
  data type.  Specifying a parameter type is not required when updating a parameter. You must
  specify a parameter type when creating a parameter.

    reset_service_setting(setting_id)
    reset_service_setting(setting_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an AWS service. This setting defines how a
user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an AWS
service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the AWS
service team might create a default setting of \"false\". This means the user can't use
this feature unless they change the setting to \"true\" and intentionally opt in for a paid
feature. Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. AWS services teams define the
default value for a SettingId. You can't create a new SettingId, but you can overwrite the
default value if you have the ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the
GetServiceSetting API action to view the current value. Use the UpdateServiceSetting API
action to change the default setting.  Reset the service setting for the account to the
default value as provisioned by the AWS service team.

- `"DocumentHashType"`: Sha256 or Sha1.  Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.
- `"DocumentVersion"`: The SSM document version to use in the request. You can specify
  DEFAULT, LATEST, or a specific version number. If you run commands by using the AWS CLI,
  then you must escape the first two options by using a backslash. If you specify a version
  number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For example: --document-version
  \"DEFAULT\" --document-version \"LATEST\" --document-version \"3\"
- `"InstanceIds"`: The IDs of the instances where the command should run. Specifying
  instance IDs is most useful when you are targeting a limited number of instances, though
  you can specify up to 50 IDs. To target a larger number of instances, or if you prefer not
  to list individual instance IDs, we recommend using the Targets option instead. Using
  Targets, which accepts tag key-value pairs to identify the instances to send commands to,
  you can a send command to tens, hundreds, or thousands of instances at once. For more

- `"DocumentVersion"`: The version of the Automation document to use for this execution.
- `"MaxConcurrency"`: The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in parallel.
  You can specify a number, such as 10, or a percentage, such as 10%. The default value is 10.
- `"MaxErrors"`: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops running the
  automation on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for
  example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for
  example, the system stops running the automation when the fourth error is received. If you
  specify 0, then the system stops running the automation on additional targets after the
  first error result is returned. If you run an automation on 50 resources and set max-errors
  to 10%, then the system stops running the automation on additional targets when the sixth
  error is received. Executions that are already running an automation when max-errors is
  reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need
  to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set max-concurrency
  to 1 so the executions proceed one at a time.
- `"Mode"`: The execution mode of the automation. Valid modes include the following: Auto
  and Interactive. The default mode is Auto.
- `"Parameters"`: A key-value map of execution parameters, which match the declared
  parameters in the Automation document.
- `"Tags"`: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can specify a maximum of
  five tags for an automation. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways,
  such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an automation
  to identify an environment or operating system. In this case, you could specify the
  following key name/value pairs:    Key=environment,Value=test     Key=OS,Value=Windows
  To add tags to an existing patch baseline, use the AddTagsToResource action.
- `"TargetLocations"`: A location is a combination of AWS Regions and/or AWS accounts where
  you want to run the Automation. Use this action to start an Automation in multiple Regions
  and multiple accounts. For more information, see Running Automation workflows in multiple
  AWS Regions and accounts in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `"TargetMaps"`: A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
  Targets and TargetMaps cannot be specified together.
- `"TargetParameterName"`: The name of the parameter used as the target resource for the
  rate-controlled execution. Required if you specify targets.
- `"Targets"`: A key-value mapping to target resources. Required if you specify
  TargetParameterName.

    update_association(association_id)
    update_association(association_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates an association. You can update the association name and version, the document
version, schedule, parameters, and Amazon S3 output.  In order to call this API action,
your IAM user account, group, or role must be configured with permission to call the
DescribeAssociation API action. If you don't have permission to call DescribeAssociation,
then you receive the following error: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when
calling the UpdateAssociation operation: User: &lt;user_arn&gt; is not authorized to
perform: ssm:DescribeAssociation on resource: &lt;resource_arn&gt;   When you update an
association, the association immediately runs against the specified targets.

# Arguments
- `association_id`: The ID of the association you want to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval"`: By default, when you update an association, the system runs
  it immediately after it is updated and then according to the schedule you specified.
  Specify this option if you don't want an association to run immediately after you update
  it. This parameter is not supported for rate expressions. Also, if you specified this
  option when you created the association, you can reset it. To do so, specify the
  no-apply-only-at-cron-interval parameter when you update the association from the command
  line. This parameter forces the association to run immediately after updating it and
  according to the interval specified.
- `"AssociationName"`: The name of the association that you want to update.
- `"AssociationVersion"`: This parameter is provided for concurrency control purposes. You
  must specify the latest association version in the service. If you want to ensure that this
  request succeeds, either specify LATEST, or omit this parameter.
- `"AutomationTargetParameterName"`: Specify the target for the association. This target is
  required for associations that use an Automation document and target resources by using
  rate controls.
- `"ComplianceSeverity"`: The severity level to assign to the association.
- `"DocumentVersion"`: The document version you want update for the association.
- `"MaxConcurrency"`: The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the
  same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for
  example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the
  same time. If a new instance starts and attempts to run an association while Systems
  Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During
  the next association interval, the new instance will process its association within the
  limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
- `"MaxErrors"`: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending
  requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute
  number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If
  you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is
  received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is
  returned. If you run an association on 50 instances and set MaxError to 10%, then the
  system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are
  already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some
  of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than
  max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a
  time.
- `"Name"`: The name of the SSM document that contains the configuration information for
  the instance. You can specify Command or Automation documents. You can specify
  AWS-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from
  another account. For SSM documents that are shared with you from other AWS accounts, you
  must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:
  arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name   For example:
  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document  For AWS-predefined documents
  and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name.
  For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document.
- `"OutputLocation"`: An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.
- `"Parameters"`: The parameters you want to update for the association. If you create a
  parameter using Parameter Store, you can reference the parameter using
  {{ssm:parameter-name}}
- `"ScheduleExpression"`: The cron expression used to schedule the association that you
  want to update.
- `"SyncCompliance"`: The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO
  or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to
  determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the
  association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the
  association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a
  parameter for the PutComplianceItems API action. In this case, compliance data is not
  managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API
  action. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.
- `"TargetLocations"`: A location is a combination of AWS Regions and AWS accounts where
  you want to run the association. Use this action to update an association in multiple
  Regions and multiple accounts.
- `"Targets"`: The targets of the association.

    update_ops_item(ops_item_id)
    update_ops_item(ops_item_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Edit or change an OpsItem. You must have permission in AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) to update an OpsItem. For more information, see Getting started with OpsCenter in the
AWS Systems Manager User Guide. Operations engineers and IT professionals use OpsCenter to
view, investigate, and remediate operational issues impacting the performance and health of
their AWS resources. For more information, see AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter in the AWS
Systems Manager User Guide.

# Arguments
- `ops_item_id`: The ID of the OpsItem.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ActualEndTime"`: The time a runbook workflow ended. Currently reported only for the
  OpsItem type /aws/changerequest.
- `"ActualStartTime"`: The time a runbook workflow started. Currently reported only for the
  OpsItem type /aws/changerequest.
- `"Category"`: Specify a new category for an OpsItem.
- `"Description"`: Update the information about the OpsItem. Provide enough information so
  that users reading this OpsItem for the first time understand the issue.
- `"Notifications"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an SNS topic where notifications are
  sent when this OpsItem is edited or changed.
- `"OperationalData"`: Add new keys or edit existing key-value pairs of the OperationalData
  map in the OpsItem object. Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference
  details about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error strings, license
  keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You enter operational data as key-value
  pairs. The key has a maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20
  KB.  Operational data keys can't begin with the following: amazon, aws, amzn, ssm, /amazon,
  /aws, /amzn, /ssm.  You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the
  account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users with access
  to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the DescribeOpsItems API action) can view and
  search on the specified data. Operational data that is not searchable is only viewable by
  users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the GetOpsItem API action). Use the
  /aws/resources key in OperationalData to specify a related resource in the request. Use the
  /aws/automations key in OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the
  OpsItem. To view AWS CLI example commands that use these keys, see Creating OpsItems
  manually in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `"OperationalDataToDelete"`: Keys that you want to remove from the OperationalData map.
- `"PlannedEndTime"`: The time specified in a change request for a runbook workflow to end.
  Currently supported only for the OpsItem type /aws/changerequest.
- `"PlannedStartTime"`: The time specified in a change request for a runbook workflow to
  start. Currently supported only for the OpsItem type /aws/changerequest.
- `"Priority"`: The importance of this OpsItem in relation to other OpsItems in the system.
- `"RelatedOpsItems"`: One or more OpsItems that share something in common with the current
  OpsItems. For example, related OpsItems can include OpsItems with similar error messages,
  impacted resources, or statuses for the impacted resource.
- `"Severity"`: Specify a new severity for an OpsItem.
- `"Status"`: The OpsItem status. Status can be Open, In Progress, or Resolved. For more
  information, see Editing OpsItem details in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
- `"Title"`: A short heading that describes the nature of the OpsItem and the impacted
  resource.

change the account options for that sync. For example, if you create a sync in the
us-east-2 (Ohio) Region and you choose the Include only the current account option, you
can't edit that sync later and choose the Include all accounts from my AWS Organizations
configuration option. Instead, you must delete the first resource data sync, and create a
new one.  This API action only supports a resource data sync that was created with a
SyncFromSource SyncType.

# Arguments
- `sync_name`: The name of the resource data sync you want to update.
- `sync_source`: Specify information about the data sources to synchronize.

    update_service_setting(setting_id, setting_value)
    update_service_setting(setting_id, setting_value, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an AWS service. This setting defines how a
user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an AWS
service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the AWS
service team might create a default setting of \"false\". This means the user can't use
this feature unless they change the setting to \"true\" and intentionally opt in for a paid
feature. Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. AWS services teams define the
default value for a SettingId. You can't create a new SettingId, but you can overwrite the
default value if you have the ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the
GetServiceSetting API action to view the current value. Or, use the ResetServiceSetting to
change the value back to the original value defined by the AWS service team. Update the
service setting for the account.

# Arguments
- `setting_id`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service setting to reset. For
  example,
  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:111122223333:servicesetting/ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enable
  d. The setting ID can be one of the following.
  /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-destination
  /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-group-name
  /ssm/parameter-store/default-parameter-tier
  /ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled     /ssm/managed-instance/activation-tier
- `setting_value`: The new value to specify for the service setting. For the
  /ssm/parameter-store/default-parameter-tier setting ID, the setting value can be one of the
  following.   Standard   Advanced   Intelligent-Tiering   For the
  /ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled, and /ssm/managed-instance/activation-tier
  setting IDs, the setting value can be true or false. For the
  /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-destination setting ID, the setting value can be
  CloudWatch. For the /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-group-name setting ID, the setting
  value can be the name of a CloudWatch Logs log group.
