    create_canary(artifact_s3_location, code, execution_role_arn, name, runtime_version, schedule, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the
outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and
troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and
metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once.  Do not use CreateCanary
to modify an existing canary. Use UpdateCanary instead. To create canaries, you must have
the CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the
canary, you also need the the iam:CreateRole, iam:CreatePolicy and iam:AttachRolePolicy
permissions. For more information, see Necessary Roles and Permissions. Do not include
secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of
the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls
over the internet. For more information, see Security Considerations for Synthetics
Canaries.

# Arguments
- `artifact_s3_location`: The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from
  the test runs of this canary. Artifacts include the log file, screenshots, and HAR files.
- `code`: A structure that includes the entry point from which the canary should start
  running your script. If the script is stored in an S3 bucket, the bucket name, key, and
  version are also included.
- `execution_role_arn`: The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary. This role
  must already exist, and must include lambda.amazonaws.com as a principal in the trust
  policy. The role must also have the following permissions:    s3:PutObject
  s3:GetBucketLocation     s3:ListAllMyBuckets     cloudwatch:PutMetricData
  logs:CreateLogGroup     logs:CreateLogStream     logs:PutLogEvents
- `name`: The name for this canary. Be sure to give it a descriptive name that
  distinguishes it from other canaries in your account. Do not include secrets or proprietary
  information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the canary ARN, and the
  ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet. For more information, see Security
  Considerations for Synthetics Canaries.
- `runtime_version`: Specifies the runtime version to use for the canary. For a list of
  valid runtime versions and more information about runtime versions, see  Canary Runtime
  Versions.
- `schedule`: A structure that contains information about how often the canary is to run
  and when these test runs are to stop.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"FailureRetentionPeriodInDays"`: The number of days to retain data about failed runs of
  this canary. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid range is 1
  to 455 days.
- `"RunConfig"`: A structure that contains the configuration for individual canary runs,
  such as timeout value.
- `"SuccessRetentionPeriodInDays"`: The number of days to retain data about successful runs
  of this canary. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid range is
  1 to 455 days.
- `"Tags"`: A list of key-value pairs to associate with the canary. You can associate as
  many as 50 tags with a canary. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources.
  You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or
  change only the resources that have certain tag values.
- `"VpcConfig"`: If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure contains
  information about the subnet and security groups of the VPC endpoint. For more information,
  see  Running a Canary in a VPC.

    delete_canary(name)
    delete_canary(name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Permanently deletes the specified canary. When you delete a canary, resources used and
created by the canary are not automatically deleted. After you delete a canary that you do
not intend to use again, you should also delete the following:   The Lambda functions and
layers used by this canary. These have the prefix cwsyn-MyCanaryName .   The CloudWatch
alarms created for this canary. These alarms have a name of
Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-MyCanaryName .   Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the
canary's artifact location.   IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the
console, these roles have the name  role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-MyCanaryName
.   CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups have the name
/aws/lambda/cwsyn-MyCanaryName .    Before you delete a canary, you might want to use
GetCanary to display the information about this canary. Make note of the information
returned by this operation so that you can delete these resources after you delete the
canary.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the canary that you want to delete. To find the names of your
  canaries, use DescribeCanaries.

    describe_canaries()

This operation returns a list of the canaries in your account, along with full details
about each canary. This operation does not have resource-level authorization, so if a user
is able to use DescribeCanaries, the user can see all of the canaries in the account. A
deny policy can only be used to restrict access to all canaries. It cannot be used on
specific resources.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"MaxResults"`: Specify this parameter to limit how many canaries are returned each time
  you use the DescribeCanaries operation. If you omit this parameter, the default of 100 is
  used.

  token in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

    tag_resource(tags, resource_arn)
    tag_resource(tags, resource_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified canary.  Tags can help you
organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by
granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags
don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted strictly as strings of
characters. You can use the TagResource action with a canary that already has tags. If you
specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated
with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new
tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as
many as 50 tags with a canary.
