    AbortMultipartUpload()

This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.  To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage, you should call the ListParts operation and ensure that the parts list is empty. For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload API and Permissions. The following operations are related to AbortMultipartUpload:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     ListParts     ListMultipartUploads   

# Required Parameters
- `Bucket`: The bucket name to which the upload was taking place.  When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using Access Points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
- `Key`: Key of the object for which the multipart upload was initiated.
- `uploadId`: Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.

# Optional Parameters
- `x-amz-request-payer`:

    CompleteMultipartUpload()

Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts. You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the ETag value, returned after that part was uploaded. Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded. Note that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests. For more information, see Amazon S3 Error Best Practices. For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload. For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload API and Permissions.  CompleteMultipartUpload has the following special errors:   Error code: EntityTooSmall    Description: Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum allowed object size. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part.   400 Bad Request     Error code: InvalidPart    Description: One or more of the specified parts could not be found. The part might not have been uploaded, or the specified entity tag might not have matched the part's entity tag.   400 Bad Request     Error code: InvalidPartOrder    Description: The list of parts was not in ascending order. The parts list must be specified in order by part number.   400 Bad Request     Error code: NoSuchUpload    Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.   404 Not Found     The following operations are related to CompleteMultipartUpload:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     AbortMultipartUpload     ListParts     ListMultipartUploads   

# Required Parameters

    CopyObject()

Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.  You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API.  All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. For more information, see REST Authentication. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.  If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.  The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing.  Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more information, see Transfer Acceleration.   Metadata  When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see Using ACLs.  To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the x-amz-metadata-directive header. When you grant permissions, you can use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see Specifying Conditions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide. For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3.   x-amz-copy-source-if Headers  To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the Etag matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters:    x-amz-copy-source-if-match     x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match     x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since     x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since     If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:    x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true    x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false   If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the 412 Precondition Failed response code:    x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false    x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true    All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed.   Encryption  The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted. The source object can be encrypted with server-side encryption using AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or by using a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it.  You can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to request server-side encryption for the target object. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS, regardless of the form of server-side encryption that was used to encrypt the source object. You can even request encryption if the source object was not encrypted. For more information about server-side encryption, see Using Server-Side Encryption.  Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API.   Storage Class Options  You can use the CopyObject operation to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the StorageClass parameter. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide.  Versioning  By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId subresource. If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header in the response. If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null. If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see . The following operations are related to CopyObject:    PutObject     GetObject    For more information, see Copying Objects.

    CreateBucket()

Creates a new bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information on bucket naming restrictions, see Working with Amazon S3 Buckets. By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see How to Select a Region for Your Buckets.  If you send your create bucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual Hosting of Buckets.  When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.   Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:  x-amz-grant-read: id=\"11112222333\", id=\"444455556666\"      You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  The following operations are related to CreateBucket:    PutObject     DeleteBucket   

# Required Parameters
- `Bucket`: The name of the bucket to create.

# Optional Parameters
- `CreateBucketConfiguration`: The configuration information for the bucket.
- `x-amz-acl`: The canned ACL to apply to the bucket.
- `x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled`: Specifies whether you want S3 Object Lock to be enabled for the new bucket.
- `x-amz-grant-full-control`: Allows grantee the read, write, read ACP, and write ACP permissions on the bucket.
- `x-amz-grant-read`: Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket.
- `x-amz-grant-read-acp`: Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL.
- `x-amz-grant-write`: Allows grantee to create, overwrite, and delete any object in the bucket.
- `x-amz-grant-write-acp`: Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket.

    CreateMultipartUpload()

This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see UploadPart). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview. If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload API and Permissions. For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4).   After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.   You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in UploadPart) and UploadPartCopy) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload.  To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have permission to the kms:Encrypt, kms:Decrypt, kms:ReEncrypt*, kms:GenerateDataKey*, and kms:DescribeKey actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.  For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption.  Access Permissions  When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview.   You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers  You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key.    Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.   x-amz-server-side​-encryption   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id   x-amz-server-side-encryption-context    If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don't provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.   All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.  For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS.   Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5   For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS.    Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see Using ACLs. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:   Specify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:   x-amz-grant-read   x-amz-grant-write   x-amz-grant-read-acp   x-amz-grant-write-acp   x-amz-grant-full-control   You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:  x-amz-grant-read: id=\"11112222333\", id=\"444455556666\"       The following operations are related to CreateMultipartUpload:    UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     AbortMultipartUpload     ListParts     ListMultipartUploads

    DeleteObject()

Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects. To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, x-amz-delete-marker, to true.  If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the x-amz-mfa request header in the DELETE versionId request. Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS.   For more information about MFA Delete, see Using MFA Delete. To see sample requests that use versioning, see Sample Request.  You can delete objects by explicitly calling the DELETE Object API or configure its lifecycle (PutBucketLifecycle) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the s3:DeleteObject, s3:DeleteObjectVersion, and s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration actions.

When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using Access Points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
- `Key`: Key name of the object to delete.

# Optional Parameters
- `versionId`: VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

    DeleteObjects()

This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead. The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.  The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body. When performing this operation on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see  MFA Delete. Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit. The following operations are related to DeleteObjects:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     ListParts     AbortMultipartUpload

If you are still using previous version of the lifecycle configuration, it works. For the earlier API description, see GetBucketLifecycle.  Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For information about lifecycle configuration, see Object Lifecycle Management. To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission, by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.

"""
    GetObject()

Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use GET, you must have READ access to the object. If you grant READ access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header. An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object sample.jpg, you can name it photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the GET operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the resource as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the resource as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification. To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent. For more information, see Amazon S3 Torrent. For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see GetObjectAcl. If the object you are retrieving is stored in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using . Otherwise, this operation returns an InvalidObjectStateError error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects. Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5   For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys). Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the s3:GetObjectVersionTagging action), the response also returns the x-amz-tagging-count header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.  Permissions  You need the s3:GetObject permission for this operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 (\"no such key\") error.   If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 (\"access denied\") error.    Versioning  By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the versionId subresource.  If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.  For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning.   Overriding Response Header Values  There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request. You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are Content-Type, Content-Language, Expires, Cache-Control, Content-Disposition, and Content-Encoding. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.  You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.     response-content-type     response-content-language     response-expires     response-cache-control     response-content-disposition     response-content-encoding     Additional Considerations about Request Headers  If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates to true, and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.  If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-None-Match condition evaluates to false, and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code. For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232. The following operations are related to GetObject:    ListBuckets     GetObjectAcl   

# Required Parameters
- `Bucket`: The bucket name containing the object.  When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using Access Points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
- `Key`: Key of the object to get.

# Optional Parameters
- `If-Match`: Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one specified, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).
- `If-Modified-Since`: Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).
- `If-None-Match`: Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the one specified, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).
- `If-Unmodified-Since`: Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified time, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).
- `Range`: Downloads the specified range bytes of an object. For more information about the HTTP Range header, see https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35.  Amazon S3 doesn't support retrieving multiple ranges of data per GET request. 
- `partNumber`: Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' GET request for the part specified. Useful for downloading just a part of an object.
- `response-cache-control`: Sets the Cache-Control header of the response.
- `response-content-disposition`: Sets the Content-Disposition header of the response
- `response-content-encoding`: Sets the Content-Encoding header of the response.
- `response-content-language`: Sets the Content-Language header of the response.
- `response-content-type`: Sets the Content-Type header of the response.
- `response-expires`: Sets the Expires header of the response.
- `versionId`: VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.
- `x-amz-request-payer`: 
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`: Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm header.
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

This operation is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to access it. The operation returns a 200 OK if the bucket exists and you have permission to access it. Otherwise, the operation might return responses such as 404 Not Found and 403 Forbidden.  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:ListBucket action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.

# Required Parameters
- `Bucket`: The bucket name.

    HeadObject()

The HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This operation is useful if you're only interested in an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the object. A HEAD request has the same options as a GET operation on an object. The response is identical to the GET response except that there is no response body. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers:   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5   For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys).  Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.  Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see Common Request Headers. Consider the following when using request headers:    Consideration 1 – If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows:    If-Match condition evaluates to true, and;    If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false;   Then Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.    Consideration 2 – If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows:    If-None-Match condition evaluates to false, and;    If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true;   Then Amazon S3 returns the 304 Not Modified response code.   For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.  Permissions  You need the s3:GetObject permission for this operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 (\"no such key\") error.   If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 (\"access denied\") error.   The following operation is related to HeadObject:    GetObject   

# Required Parameters
- `Bucket`: The name of the bucket containing the object.
- `Key`: The object key.

# Optional Parameters
- `If-Match`: Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one specified, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).
- `If-Modified-Since`: Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).
- `If-None-Match`: Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the one specified, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).
- `If-Unmodified-Since`: Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified time, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).
- `Range`: Downloads the specified range bytes of an object. For more information about the HTTP Range header, see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35.  Amazon S3 doesn't support retrieving multiple ranges of data per GET request. 
- `partNumber`: Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for the part specified. Useful querying about the size of the part and the number of parts in this object.
- `versionId`: VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.
- `x-amz-request-payer`: 
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`: Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm header.
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

    ListMultipartUploads()

This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated using the Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. This operation returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. 1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can include, which is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the max-uploads parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list criteria, the response will contain an IsTruncated element with the value true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the key-marker and upload-id-marker request parameters. In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation time. For more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload.

The following operations are related to ListMultipartUploads:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     ListParts     AbortMultipartUpload   

# Required Parameters
- `Bucket`: Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.  When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using Access Points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

# Optional Parameters
- `delimiter`: Character you use to group keys. All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped under a single result element, CommonPrefixes. If you don't specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped under CommonPrefixes result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.
- `encoding-type`: 
- `key-marker`: Together with upload-id-marker, this parameter specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin. If upload-id-marker is not specified, only the keys lexicographically greater than the specified key-marker will be included in the list. If upload-id-marker is specified, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the key-marker might also be included, provided those multipart uploads have upload IDs lexicographically greater than the specified upload-id-marker.
- `max-uploads`: Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to return in the response body. 1,000 is the maximum number of uploads that can be returned in a response.
- `prefix`: Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)
- `upload-id-marker`: Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin. If key-marker is not specified, the upload-id-marker parameter is ignored.

    PutBucketAcl()

Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see Using ACLs. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have WRITE_ACP permission. You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:   Specify the ACL in the request body   Specify permissions using request headers    You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.  Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.  Access Permissions  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-write: uri=\"http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery\", id=\"111122223333\", id=\"555566667777\"     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly.

    PutBucketAnalyticsConfiguration()

Sets an analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the analytics configuration ID). You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket. You can choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports sent to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file. See the DataExport request element. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object filters that you configure. When selecting data export, you specify a destination bucket and an optional destination prefix where the file is written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different account. However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as the bucket that you are making the PUT analytics configuration to. For more information, see Amazon S3 Analytics – Storage Class Analysis.   You must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket where the exported file is written to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket. For an example policy, see Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis.  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:PutAnalyticsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

    PutBucketCors()

Sets the cors configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it. To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the s3:PutBucketCORS action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others. You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is http://www.example.com to access your Amazon S3 bucket at my.example.bucket.com by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest capability. To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the cors subresource to the bucket. The cors subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.  When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the cors configuration on the bucket and uses the first CORSRule rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:   The request's Origin header must match AllowedOrigin elements.   The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the Access-Control-Request-Method header in case of a pre-flight OPTIONS request must be one of the AllowedMethod elements.    Every header specified in the Access-Control-Request-Headers request header of a pre-flight request must match an AllowedHeader element.

    PutBucketInventoryConfiguration()

This implementation of the PUT operation adds an inventory configuration (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 inventory configurations per bucket.  Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is inventoried is called the source bucket, and the bucket where the inventory flat file is stored is called the destination bucket. The destination bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the source bucket.  When you configure an inventory for a source bucket, you specify the destination bucket where you want the inventory to be stored, and whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also configure what object metadata to include and whether to inventory all object versions or only current versions. For more information, see Amazon S3 Inventory in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.  You must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in the defined location.

    PutBucketNotificationConfiguration()

Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more information about event notifications, see Configuring Event Notifications. Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the specified type. By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification configuration will be an empty NotificationConfiguration.  &lt;NotificationConfiguration&gt;   &lt;/NotificationConfiguration&gt;  This operation replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you include in the request body. After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case of AWS Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events. You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element. By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with s3:PutBucketNotification permission.  The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT operation will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.   Responses  If the configuration in the request body includes only one TopicConfiguration specifying only the s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event type, the response will also include the x-amz-sns-test-message-id header containing the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

    PutBucketReplication()

 Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For more information, see Replication in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.   To perform this operation, the user or role performing the operation must have the iam:PassRole permission.  Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information. A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset. All rules must specify the same destination bucket. To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and Priority.  The latest version of the replication configuration XML is V2. XML V2 replication configurations are those that contain the Filter element for rules, and rules that specify S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC). In XML V2 replication configurations, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate delete markers. Therefore, you must set the DeleteMarkerReplication element to Disabled. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the XML V1 replication configuration.  For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Using Versioning. By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information about permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.  Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects  By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS.

    PutBucketTagging()

Sets the tags for a bucket. Use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see Cost Allocation and Tagging.  Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags.  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:PutBucketTagging action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.  PutBucketTagging has the following special errors:   Error code: InvalidTagError    Description: The tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can occur if the tag did not pass input validation. For information about tag restrictions, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions and AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tag Restrictions.

    PutBucketVersioning()

Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket. To set the versioning state, you must be the bucket owner. You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:  Enabled—Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.  Suspended—Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null. If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a GetBucketVersioning request does not return a versioning state value. If the bucket owner enables MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header and the Status and the MfaDelete request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the bucket.  If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.) For more information, see Lifecycle and Versioning.

    PutBucketWebsite()

Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the website subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this subresource on the bucket with website configuration information such as the file name of the index document and any redirect rules. For more information, see Hosting Websites on Amazon S3. This PUT operation requires the S3:PutBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the S3:PutBucketWebsite permission. To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add a website configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are sent to another website, you don't need to provide index document name for the bucket.    WebsiteConfiguration     RedirectAllRequestsTo     HostName     Protocol    If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the following elements to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting requests and information about the redirect destination.

    PutObject()

Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it. Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead. To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.   The Content-MD5 header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.    Server-side Encryption  You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption keys. For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption.  Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API.   Storage Class Options  By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD storage class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different storage class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide.  Versioning  If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects. For more information about versioning, see Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning.   Related Resources     CopyObject     DeleteObject   

# Required Parameters
- `Bucket`: Bucket name to which the PUT operation was initiated.  When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using Access Points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
- `Key`: Object key for which the PUT operation was initiated.

# Optional Parameters
- `Body`: Object data.
- `Cache-Control`:  Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain. For more information, see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.
- `Content-Disposition`: Specifies presentational information for the object. For more information, see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1.
- `Content-Encoding`: Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. For more information, see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11.
- `Content-Language`: The language the content is in.
- `Content-Length`: Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the body cannot be determined automatically. For more information, see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13.
- `Content-MD5`: The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the message (without the headers) according to RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was originally sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For more information about REST request authentication, see REST Authentication.
- `Content-Type`: A standard MIME type describing the format of the contents. For more information, see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17.
- `Expires`: The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. For more information, see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21.
- `x-amz-acl`: The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see Canned ACL.
- `x-amz-grant-full-control`: Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object.
- `x-amz-grant-read`: Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
- `x-amz-grant-read-acp`: Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
- `x-amz-grant-write-acp`: Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
- `x-amz-meta-`: A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
- `x-amz-object-lock-legal-hold`: Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see Object Lock.
- `x-amz-object-lock-mode`: The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.
- `x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date`: The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.
- `x-amz-request-payer`: 
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption`: The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`: If x-amz-server-side-encryption is present and has the value of aws:kms, this header specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) symmetrical customer managed customer master key (CMK) that was used for the object.  If the value of x-amz-server-side-encryption is aws:kms, this header specifies the ID of the symmetric customer managed AWS KMS CMK that will be used for the object. If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but do not provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS to protect the data.
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`: Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`: Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm header.
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
- `x-amz-storage-class`: If you don't specify, S3 Standard is the default storage class. Amazon S3 supports other storage classes.
- `x-amz-tagging`: The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters. (For example, \"Key1=Value1\")
- `x-amz-website-redirect-location`: If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For information about object metadata, see Object Key and Metadata. In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:  x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html  In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website:  x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/  For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 and How to Configure Website Page Redirects.

    PutObjectAcl()

Uses the acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for an object that already exists in a bucket. You must have WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object. Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.  Access Permissions  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects permission to the two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress=\"xyz@amazon.com\", emailAddress=\"abc@amazon.com\"     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person's ID:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"CanonicalUser\"&gt;&lt;ID&gt;&lt;&gt;ID&lt;&gt;&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;DisplayName&gt;&lt;&gt;GranteesEmail&lt;&gt;&lt;/DisplayName&gt; &lt;/Grantee&gt;  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.   By URI:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"Group\"&gt;&lt;URI&gt;&lt;&gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers&lt;&gt;&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Grantee&gt;    By Email address:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"AmazonCustomerByEmail\"&gt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&lt;&gt;Grantees@email.com&lt;&gt;&lt;/EmailAddress&gt;lt;/Grantee&gt;  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.     Versioning  The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the versionId subresource.  Related Resources     CopyObject     GetObject   

# Required Parameters
- `Bucket`: The bucket name that contains the object to which you want to attach the ACL.  When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname.

    PutPublicAccessBlock()

Creates or modifies the PublicAccessBlock configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy.  When Amazon S3 evaluates the PublicAccessBlock configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the PublicAccessBlock configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the PublicAccessBlock configurations are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

    RestoreObject()

Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3 This operation performs the following types of requests:     select - Perform a select query on an archived object    restore an archive - Restore an archived object   To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:RestoreObject action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.  Querying Archives with Select Requests  You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. When making a select request, do the following:   Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. For more information about the S3 structure in the request body, see the following:    PutObject     Managing Access with ACLs in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide     Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide      Define the SQL expression for the SELECT type of restoration for your query in the request body's SelectParameters structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.   The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  SELECT * FROM Object    Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.  SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100    If you have headers and you set the fileHeaderInfo in the CSV structure in the request body to USE, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the fileHeaderInfo field to IGNORE, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s      For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.  When making a select request, you can also do the following:   To expedite your queries, specify the Expedited tier. For more information about tiers, see \"Restoring Archives,\" later in this topic.   Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.   The following are additional important facts about the select feature:   The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.   You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.    Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response 409.    Restoring Archives  Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from.  To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version. The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being restored from and which data access tier you specify.  When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:      Expedited  - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.     Standard  - S3 Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. S3 Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.      Bulk  - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.   For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.  You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing another restore request to the same object, setting a new Tier request element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters, such as the Days request element. For more information, see  Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.  To get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object. If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.  Responses  A successful operation returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status code.    If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns 202 Accepted in the response.    If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the response.     Special Errors          Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress     Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

    SelectObjectContent()

This operation filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a simple structured query language (SQL) statement. In the request, along with the SQL expression, you must also specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data serialization format for the response. For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see Selecting Content from Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. For more information about using SQL with Amazon S3 Select, see  SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   Permissions  You must have s3:GetObject permission for this operation. Amazon S3 Select does not support anonymous access. For more information about permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   Object Data Formats  You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following format properties:    CSV, JSON, and Parquet - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format.    UTF-8 - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.    GZIP or BZIP2 - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.    Server-side encryption - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects that are protected with server-side encryption. For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are documented in the GetObject. For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't need to specify anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.    Working with the Response Body  Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a series of messages and includes a Transfer-Encoding header with chunked as its value in the response. For more information, see RESTSelectObjectAppendix .   GetObject Support  The SelectObjectContent operation does not support the following GetObject functionality. For more information, see GetObject.    Range: Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3 Select request (see SelectObjectContentRequestScanRange in the request parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of an object to return.    GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE and REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes: You cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes.

    UploadPart()

Uploads a part in a multipart upload.  In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.   You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload. To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.   Note: After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage. For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide . For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to Multipart Upload API and Permissions in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload. For more information, go to Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see CreateMultipartUpload. If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers.   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key   x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5    Special Errors          Code: NoSuchUpload     Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.

    UploadPartCopy()

Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data source by adding the request header x-amz-copy-source in your request and a byte range by adding the request header x-amz-copy-source-range in your request.  The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about multipart upload limits, go to Quick Facts in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the UploadPart operation and provide data in your request.  You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request. For more information about using the UploadPartCopy operation, see the following:   For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload API and Permissions in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   For information about copying objects using a single atomic operation vs. the multipart upload, see Operations on Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation, see CopyObject and UploadPart.   Note the following additional considerations about the request headers x-amz-copy-source-if-match, x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match, x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since, and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since:      Consideration 1 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request as follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true, and;  x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false; Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data.     Consideration 2 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request as follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false, and;  x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true; Amazon S3 returns 412 Precondition Failed response code.     Versioning  If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the x-amz-copy-source, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the x-amz-copy-source and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the x-amz-copy-source.  You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the versionId subresource as shown in the following example:  x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id   Special Errors          Code: NoSuchUpload     Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.
