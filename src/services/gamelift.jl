    accept_match(acceptance_type, player_ids, ticket_id)
    accept_match(acceptance_type, player_ids, ticket_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking
configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that
configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a
specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved
in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for
your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for
tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error. To register
acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players
have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status PLACING, where a new
game session is created for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances
are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking
tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected
the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match. For tickets
where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to CANCELLED, and
processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as
needed.   Learn more    Add FlexMatch to a Game Client    FlexMatch Events Reference

    claim_game_server(game_server_group_name)
    claim_game_server(game_server_group_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.
Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players.
This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to
request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an
available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds, and returns connection
information that players can use to connect to the game server.  To claim a game server,
identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach
bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to
the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information.
When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed
game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE while the claim status is set to CLAIMED
for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to
UTILIZED (using UpdateGameServer) once players join. If the game server's status is not
updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to
be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not
configurable. If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the
following cases:   If the game server utilization status is UTILIZED.   If the game server
claim status is CLAIMED.    When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed
even if the game server is running on an instance in DRAINING status. To avoid this, first
check the instance status by calling DescribeGameServerInstances.   Learn more   GameLift

# Arguments
- `game_server_group_name`: A unique identifier for the game server group where the game
  server is running. Use either the GameServerGroup name or ARN value.. If you are not
  specifying a game server to claim, this value identifies where you want GameLift FleetIQ to
  look for an available game server to claim.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"GameServerData"`: A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string
  value. This data is passed to a game client or service when it requests information on game
  servers using ListGameServers or ClaimGameServer.
- `"GameServerId"`: A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server to claim. If
  this parameter is left empty, GameLift FleetIQ searches for an available game server in the
  specified game server group.

    create_alias(name, routing_strategy)
    create_alias(name, routing_strategy, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a
fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when
redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game
build.  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and
terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display
messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you
might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to
direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing
strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a
fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including
an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: A human-readable description of the alias.
- `"Tags"`: A list of labels to assign to the new alias resource. Tags are

    create_build()
    create_build(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary files. Game server
binaries must be combined into a zip file for use with Amazon GameLift.   When setting up a
new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the AWS CLI command  upload-build . This
helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to
a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates a new build resource.   The CreateBuild
operation can used in the following scenarios:   To create a new game build with build
files that are in an S3 location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option,
you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the S3 bucket. With permissions in place,
call CreateBuild and specify a build name, operating system, and the S3 storage location of
your game build.   To directly upload your build files to a GameLift S3 location. To use
this option, first call CreateBuild and specify a build name and operating system. This
operation creates a new build resource and also returns an S3 location with temporary
access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the
specified S3 location. For more information, see Uploading Objects in the Amazon S3
Developer Guide. Build files can be uploaded to the GameLift S3 location once only; that
can't be updated.    If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a
unique build ID and places it in INITIALIZED status. A build must be in READY status before
you can create fleets with it.  Learn more   Uploading Your Game    Create a Build with

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Name"`: A descriptive label that is associated with a build. Build names do not need to
  be unique. You can use UpdateBuild to change this value later.
- `"OperatingSystem"`: The operating system that the game server binaries are built to run
  on. This value determines the type of fleet resources that you can use for this build. If
  your game build contains multiple executables, they all must run on the same operating
  system. If an operating system is not specified when creating a build, Amazon GameLift uses
  the default value (WINDOWS_2012). This value cannot be changed later.
- `"StorageLocation"`: The location where your game build files are stored. Use this
  parameter only when creating a build using files that are stored in an S3 bucket that you
  own. Identify an S3 bucket name and key, which must in the same Region where you're
  creating a build. This parameter must also specify the ARN for an IAM role that you've set
  up to give Amazon GameLift access your S3 bucket. To call this operation with a storage
  location, you must have IAM PassRole permission. For more details on IAM roles and PassRole
  permissions, see  Set up a role for GameLift access.
- `"Tags"`: A list of labels to assign to the new build resource. Tags are
  developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource

    create_fleet(ec2_instance_type, name)
    create_fleet(ec2_instance_type, name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. whether they are custom game builds or
Realtime Servers with game-specific script. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can host multiple game sessions. When creating
a fleet, you choose the hardware specifications, set some configuration options, and
specify the game server to deploy on the new fleet.  To create a new fleet, provide the
following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an EC2 instance type and fleet type (spot or on-demand),
(3) the build ID for your game build or script ID if using Realtime Servers, and (4) a
runtime configuration, which determines how game servers will run on each instance in the
fleet.  If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following
tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the fleet status or by monitoring
fleet creation events:   Creates a fleet resource. Status: NEW.   Begins writing events to
the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.   Sets the
fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which triggers Amazon GameLift to start
one new EC2 instance.   Downloads the game build or Realtime script to the new instance and
installs it. Statuses: DOWNLOADING, VALIDATING, BUILDING.    Starts launching server
processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per
instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each process launch by a few seconds. Status:
ACTIVATING.   Sets the fleet's status to ACTIVE as soon as one server process is ready to
host a game session.    Learn more   Setting Up Fleets   Debug Fleet Creation Issues

# Arguments
- `ec2_instance_type`: The name of an EC2 instance type that is supported in Amazon
  GameLift. A fleet instance type determines the computing resources of each instance in the
  fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. Amazon GameLift supports
  the following EC2 instance types. See Amazon EC2 Instance Types for detailed descriptions.
- `name`: A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to
  be unique.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"BuildId"`: A unique identifier for a build to be deployed on the new fleet. You can use
  either the build ID or ARN value. The custom game server build must have been successfully
  uploaded to Amazon GameLift and be in a READY status. This fleet setting cannot be changed
  once the fleet is created.
- `"CertificateConfiguration"`: Indicates whether to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the
  new fleet. TLS certificates are used for encrypting traffic between game clients and game
  servers running on GameLift. If this parameter is not specified, the default value,
  DISABLED, is used. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created. Learn
  more at Securing Client/Server Communication.  Note: This feature requires the AWS
  Certificate Manager (ACM) service, which is available in the AWS global partition but not
  in all other partitions. When working in a partition that does not support this feature, a
  request for a new fleet with certificate generation results fails with a 4xx unsupported
  Region error. Valid values include:     GENERATED - Generate a TLS/SSL certificate for this
  fleet.    DISABLED - (default) Do not generate a TLS/SSL certificate for this fleet.
- `"Description"`: A human-readable description of a fleet.
- `"EC2InboundPermissions"`: Range of IP addresses and port settings that permit inbound
  traffic to access game sessions that are running on the fleet. For fleets using a custom
  game build, this parameter is required before game sessions running on the fleet can accept
  connections. For Realtime Servers fleets, Amazon GameLift automatically sets TCP and UDP
  ranges for use by the Realtime servers. You can specify multiple permission settings or add
  more by updating the fleet.
- `"FleetType"`: Indicates whether to use On-Demand instances or Spot instances for this
  fleet. If empty, the default is ON_DEMAND. Both categories of instances use identical
  hardware and configurations based on the instance type selected for this fleet. Learn more
  about  On-Demand versus Spot Instances.
- `"InstanceRoleArn"`: A unique identifier for an AWS IAM role that manages access to your
  AWS services. Fleets with an instance role ARN allow applications that are running on the
  fleet's instances to assume the role. Learn more about using on-box credentials for your
  game servers at  Access external resources from a game server. To call this operation with
  instance role ARN, you must have IAM PassRole permissions. See IAM policy examples for
  GameLift.
- `"LogPaths"`: This parameter is no longer used. Instead, to specify where Amazon GameLift
  should store log files once a server process shuts down, use the Amazon GameLift server API
  ProcessReady() and specify one or more directory paths in logParameters. See more
  information in the Server API Reference.
- `"MetricGroups"`: The name of an Amazon CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A
  metric group aggregates the metrics for all fleets in the group. Specify an existing metric
  group name, or provide a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can only be
  included in one metric group at a time.
- `"NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy"`: A game session protection policy to apply to all
  instances in this fleet. If this parameter is not set, instances in this fleet default to
  no protection. You can change a fleet's protection policy using UpdateFleetAttributes, but
  this change will only affect sessions created after the policy change. You can also set
  protection for individual instances using UpdateGameSession.    NoProtection - The game
  session can be terminated during a scale-down event.    FullProtection - If the game
  session is in an ACTIVE status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
- `"PeerVpcAwsAccountId"`: A unique identifier for the AWS account with the VPC that you
  want to peer your Amazon GameLift fleet with. You can find your account ID in the AWS
  Management Console under account settings.
- `"PeerVpcId"`: A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon
  GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use
  the VPC Dashboard in the AWS Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in VPC
  Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets.
- `"ResourceCreationLimitPolicy"`: A policy that limits the number of game sessions an
  individual player can create over a span of time for this fleet.
- `"RuntimeConfiguration"`: Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in
  the fleet. Server processes run either a custom game build executable or a Realtime script.
  The runtime configuration defines the server executables or launch script file, launch
  parameters, and the number of processes to run concurrently on each instance. When creating
  a fleet, the runtime configuration must have at least one server process configuration;
  otherwise the request fails with an invalid request exception. (This parameter replaces the
  parameters ServerLaunchPath and ServerLaunchParameters, although requests that contain
  values for these parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue to work.) This
  parameter is required unless the parameters ServerLaunchPath and ServerLaunchParameters are
  defined. Runtime configuration replaced these parameters, but fleets that use them will
  continue to work.
- `"ScriptId"`: A unique identifier for a Realtime script to be deployed on the new fleet.
  You can use either the script ID or ARN value. The Realtime script must have been
  successfully uploaded to Amazon GameLift. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the
  fleet is created.
- `"ServerLaunchParameters"`: This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify server
  launch parameters in the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. (Requests that specify a server
  launch path and launch parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue to work.)
- `"ServerLaunchPath"`: This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify a server launch
  path using the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. Requests that specify a server launch path
  and launch parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue to work.
- `"Tags"`: A list of labels to assign to the new fleet resource. Tags are
  developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource
  management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see  Tagging AWS
  Resources in the AWS General Reference. Once the resource is created, you can use
  TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags. The
  maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual

 This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.
Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of
Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group,
creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account, and establishes a link between the two
groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game
server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch. Before creating a new
game server group, you must have the following:    An Amazon EC2 launch template that
specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build. For more
information, see  Launching an Instance from a Launch Template in the Amazon EC2 User
Guide.    An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift
FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see
Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction in the GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide.
To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2
launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You
must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can
optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ
metric. Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you
have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several
properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size
and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep
in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift
FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.  Learn

# Arguments
- `game_server_group_name`: An identifier for the new game server group. This value is used
  to generate unique ARN identifiers for the EC2 Auto Scaling group and the GameLift FleetIQ
  game server group. The name must be unique per Region per AWS account.
- `instance_definitions`: The EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling
  group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types that are
  supported by GameLift FleetIQ. For more information on instance types, see EC2 Instance
  Types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each
  instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the
  default value \"1\". For more information about capacity weighting, see  Instance Weighting
  for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
- `launch_template`: The EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game
  server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. You can specify the
  template using either the template name or ID. For help with creating a launch template,
  see Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
  User Guide. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto
  Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
- `max_size`: The maximum number of instances allowed in the EC2 Auto Scaling group. During
  automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this
  maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto
  Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
- `min_size`: The minimum number of instances allowed in the EC2 Auto Scaling group. During
  automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale down the group below this
  minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling
  group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS
  console or APIs.
- `role_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to
  access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AutoScalingPolicy"`: Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto
  Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric
  \"PercentUtilizedGameServers\" to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can
  immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created,
  update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
- `"BalancingStrategy"`: Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances
  and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:
  SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
  unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting
  capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started,
  and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and
  are not replaced.    SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever
  available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server
  group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances.
  Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
  replaced with new On-Demand Instances.    ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are
  used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this
  balancing strategy is in force.
- `"GameServerProtectionPolicy"`: A flag that indicates whether instances in the game
  server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active
  game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be
  dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game
  servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An
  exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of
  protection status. This property is set to NO_PROTECTION by default.
- `"Tags"`: A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags are
  developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources is useful for resource management,
  access management, and cost allocation. For more information, see  Tagging AWS Resources in
  the AWS General Reference. Once the resource is created, you can use TagResource,
  UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags, respectively. The
  maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual
  tagging limits.
- `"VpcSubnets"`: A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in
  the game server group. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are
  used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot
  be updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group
  will always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the Auto Scaling
  group is updated directly.

Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This operation creates a game session
record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game
session. A fleet must have an ACTIVE status before a game session can be created in it. To
create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of
players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific
properties for this game session. If successful, a GameSession object is returned
containing the game session properties and other settings you specified.  Idempotency
tokens. You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful
for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same
idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result.
All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may
change.  Resource creation limits. If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a
resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this
ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.
Player acceptance policy. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players.
You can restrict new player access by using UpdateGameSession to change the game session's

# Arguments
- `maximum_player_session_count`: The maximum number of players that can be connected
  simultaneously to the game session.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AliasId"`: A unique identifier for an alias associated with the fleet to create a game
  session in. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value. Each request must reference
  either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.
- `"CreatorId"`: A unique identifier for a player or entity creating the game session. This
  ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists) that limits the number
  of concurrent active game sessions one player can have.
- `"FleetId"`: A unique identifier for a fleet to create a game session in. You can use
  either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias
  ID, but not both.
- `"GameProperties"`: Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value
  pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with
  a request to start a new game session (see Start a Game Session).
- `"GameSessionData"`: Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string
  value. This data is passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with a
  request to start a new game session (see Start a Game Session).
- `"GameSessionId"`:  This parameter is no longer preferred. Please use IdempotencyToken
  instead. Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game session. Maximum
  token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game
  session's ID. (A game session ARN has the following format:
  arn:aws:gamelift:&lt;region&gt;::gamesession/&lt;fleet ID&gt;/&lt;custom ID string or
  idempotency token&gt;.)
- `"IdempotencyToken"`: Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game
  session. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the
  new game session's ID. (A game session ARN has the following format:
  arn:aws:gamelift:&lt;region&gt;::gamesession/&lt;fleet ID&gt;/&lt;custom ID string or
  idempotency token&gt;.) Idempotency tokens remain in use for 30 days after a game session
  has ended; game session objects are retained for this time period and then deleted.
- `"Name"`: A descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do
  not need to be unique.

    create_game_session_queue(name)
    create_game_session_queue(name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue
identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations
(fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You
can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple Regions. To add
placement requests to a queue, call StartGameSessionPlacement and reference the queue name.
 Destination order. When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries
each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game
session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default
order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency
information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations
where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session
where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.  Player
latency policies. For placement requests containing player latency information, use player
latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency
cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not
placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A
queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with
the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency
controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60
seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc.  To create a new
queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of
latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned.  Learn more    Design a

# Arguments
- `name`: A descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue names must
  be unique within each Region.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Destinations"`: A list of fleets that can be used to fulfill game session placement
  requests in the queue. Fleets are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN.
  Destinations are listed in default preference order.
- `"PlayerLatencyPolicies"`: A collection of latency policies to apply when processing game
  sessions placement requests with player latency information. Multiple policies are
  evaluated in order of the maximum latency value, starting with the lowest latency values.
  With just one policy, the policy is enforced at the start of the game session placement for
  the duration period. With multiple policies, each policy is enforced consecutively for its
  duration period. For example, a queue might enforce a 60-second policy followed by a
  120-second policy, and then no policy for the remainder of the placement. A player latency
  policy must set a value for MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds. If none is set,
  this API request fails.
- `"Tags"`: A list of labels to assign to the new game session queue resource. Tags are
  developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource
  management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see  Tagging AWS
  Resources in the AWS General Reference. Once the resource is created, you can use
  TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags. The
  maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual
  tagging limits.
- `"TimeoutInSeconds"`: The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement
  request remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement
  changes to a TIMED_OUT status.

    create_matchmaking_configuration(acceptance_required, name, request_timeout_seconds, rule_set_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether your are using
FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking
configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're also using
GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your matchmaking
system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking
requests (StartMatchmaking or StartMatchBackfill) identify the matchmaking configuration to
use and provide player attributes consistent with that configuration.  To create a
matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration name and FlexMatch
mode (with or without GameLift hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players
and find acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the maximum time
allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting, you also
need to identify the game session queue to use when starting a game session for the match.
In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive
matchmaking notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. An
alternative method, continuously polling ticket status with DescribeMatchmaking, is only
suitable for games in development with low matchmaking usage.  Learn more    FlexMatch

# Arguments
- `acceptance_required`: A flag that determines whether a match that was created with this
  configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE.
  With this option enabled, matchmaking tickets use the status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE to
  indicate when a completed potential match is waiting for player acceptance.
- `name`: A unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration. This name is used to
  identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or ticket.
- `request_timeout_seconds`: The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket
  can remain in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be
  resubmitted as needed.
- `rule_set_name`: A unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this
  configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A matchmaking
  configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same Region.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds"`: The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to
  accept a proposed match, if acceptance is required. If any player rejects the match or
  fails to accept before the timeout, the tickets are returned to the ticket pool and
  continue to be evaluated for an acceptable match.
- `"AdditionalPlayerCount"`: The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future
  players. For example, assume that the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a
  single 12-person team. If the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are
  initially selected for the match. This parameter is not used if FlexMatchMode is set to
  STANDALONE.
- `"BackfillMode"`: The method used to backfill game sessions that are created with this
  matchmaking configuration. Specify MANUAL when your game manages backfill requests manually
  or does not use the match backfill feature. Specify AUTOMATIC to have GameLift create a
  StartMatchBackfill request whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more
  about manual and automatic backfill in  Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch. Automatic
  backfill is not available when FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE.
- `"CustomEventData"`: Information to be added to all events related to this matchmaking
  configuration.
- `"Description"`: A human-readable description of the matchmaking configuration.
- `"FlexMatchMode"`: Indicates whether this matchmaking configuration is being used with
  GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking solution.     STANDALONE - FlexMatch forms
  matches and returns match information, including players and team assignments, in a
  MatchmakingSucceeded event.    WITH_QUEUE - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified
  GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.
- `"GameProperties"`: A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key-value
  pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with
  a request to start a new game session (see Start a Game Session). This information is added
  to the new GameSession object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not
  used if FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE.
- `"GameSessionData"`: A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single
  string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with a
  request to start a new game session (see Start a Game Session). This information is added
  to the new GameSession object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not
  used if FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE.
- `"GameSessionQueueArns"`: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is assigned to a GameLift game
  session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions.
  Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start new GameLift-hosted game
  sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. If FlexMatchMode
  is set to STANDALONE, do not set this parameter.
- `"NotificationTarget"`: An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking
  notifications.
- `"Tags"`: A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking configuration resource. Tags
  are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource
  management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see  Tagging AWS

 This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.
Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server group record. You

the game server group to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game
server groups can only be deleted if they are in ACTIVE or ERROR status. If the delete

is changed to DELETE_SCHEDULED, which prevents new game servers from being registered and
stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are
deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete
operations fail, the game server group is placed in ERROR status. GameLift FleetIQ emits

Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. These statistics provide insight
into how available hosting resources are currently being used. To get statistics on
available hosting resources, see DescribeFleetCapacity. You can request utilization data
for all fleets, or specify a list of one or more fleet IDs. When requesting multiple

    put_scaling_policy(fleet_id, metric_name, name)
    put_scaling_policy(fleet_id, metric_name, name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically
scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs
Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when
a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and
rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this
option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert
fine-grained control over auto-scaling.  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each
type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple
rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple
auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. You can temporarily suspend all
scaling policies for a fleet by calling StopFleetActions with the fleet action
AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet
action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the
policy with DeleteScalingPolicy. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up
Fleet Automatic Scaling.  Target-based policy  A target-based policy tracks a single
metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting
capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's
buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current
capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon
GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.  For example, you might
choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous
game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's
available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start
new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.  To create or
update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to
\"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a
TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On
a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in
force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are
temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are
restarted.  Rule-based policy  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a
threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a
rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy
specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for
each type of action.  For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the
percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the
fleet capacity by 10%.\" A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If
[MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then
[ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule
statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20]
for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling
policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to
\"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful
request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon
as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily
suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

  a fleet could host simultaneously, given current capacity. Use this metric for a
  target-based scaling policy.    PercentIdleInstances -- Percentage of the total number of
  active instances that are hosting zero game sessions.    QueueDepth -- Pending game session
  placement requests, in any queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority destination.
    WaitTime -- Current wait time for pending game session placement requests, in any queue,
  where the current fleet is the top-priority destination.
- `name`: A descriptive label that is associated with a scaling policy. Policy names do not
  need to be unique. A fleet can have only one scaling policy with the same name.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

- `"EvaluationPeriods"`: Length of time (in minutes) the metric must be at or beyond the
  threshold before a scaling event is triggered.
- `"PolicyType"`: The type of scaling policy to create. For a target-based policy, set the
  parameter MetricName to 'PercentAvailableGameSessions' and specify a TargetConfiguration.
  For a rule-based policy set the following parameters: MetricName, ComparisonOperator,
  Threshold, EvaluationPeriods, ScalingAdjustmentType, and ScalingAdjustment.
- `"ScalingAdjustment"`: Amount of adjustment to make, based on the scaling adjustment type.
- `"ScalingAdjustmentType"`: The type of adjustment to make to a fleet's instance count
  (see FleetCapacity):    ChangeInCapacity -- add (or subtract) the scaling adjustment value
  from the current instance count. Positive values scale up while negative values scale down.
     ExactCapacity -- set the instance count to the scaling adjustment value.
  PercentChangeInCapacity -- increase or reduce the current instance count by the scaling
  adjustment, read as a percentage. Positive values scale up while negative values scale
  down; for example, a value of \"-10\" scales the fleet down by 10%.
- `"TargetConfiguration"`: The settings for a target-based scaling policy.
- `"Threshold"`: Metric value used to trigger a scaling event.

    search_game_sessions()
    search_game_sessions(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them in a
specified order. You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:
gameSessionId -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a
GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.     gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game
session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or
updating with UpdateGameSession. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game
session.    gameSessionProperties -- Custom data defined in a game session's GameProperty
parameter. GameProperty values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must
indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for
game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair \"gameMode:brawl\", specify
the following: gameSessionProperties.gameMode = \"brawl\". All custom data values are
searched as strings.    maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a
game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession
or updating with UpdateGameSession.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game
session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.    playerSessionCount --
Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as
players join the session or drop out.    hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value
indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly
recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search
performance and return only sessions that players can join.     Returned values for
playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions
and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh
search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.   To
search or sort, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID, and provide a search filter
expression, a sort expression, or both. If successful, a collection of GameSession objects
matching the request is returned. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a
set of sequential pages.  You can search for game sessions one fleet at a time only. To
find game sessions across multiple fleets, you must search each fleet separately and
combine the results. This search feature finds only game sessions that are in ACTIVE
status. To locate games in statuses other than active, use DescribeGameSessionDetails.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AliasId"`: A unique identifier for an alias associated with the fleet to search for
  active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value. Each request must
  reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.
- `"FilterExpression"`: String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no
  filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the
  fleet that are in ACTIVE status. A filter expression can contain one or multiple
  conditions. Each condition consists of the following:    Operand -- Name of a game session
  attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties,
  maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.
  Comparator -- Valid comparators are: =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=.     Value --
  Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings
  depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single
  quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with
  the comparators = and &lt;&gt;. For example, the following filter expression searches on
  gameSessionName: \"FilterExpression\": \"gameSessionName = 'Matt's Awesome Game 1'\".    To
  chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords AND, OR, and NOT
  and parentheses as needed. For example: x AND y AND NOT z, NOT (x OR y). Session search
  evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:    =,
  &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=    Parentheses   NOT   AND   OR   For example, this
  filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open
  player slot: \"maximumSessions&gt;=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true\".
- `"FleetId"`: A unique identifier for a fleet to search for active game sessions. You can
  use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or
  alias ID, but not both.
- `"Limit"`: The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with NextToken to
  get results as a set of sequential pages. The maximum number of results returned is 20,
  even if this value is not set or is set higher than 20.
- `"NextToken"`: Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use
  the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the
  beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.
- `"SortExpression"`: Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression
  is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the
  following elements:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
  gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties, maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis,
  playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Order -- Valid sort orders are ASC
  (ascending) and DESC (descending).   For example, this sort expression returns the oldest
  active sessions first: \"SortExpression\": \"creationTimeMillis ASC\". Results with a null
  value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.

    start_game_session_placement(game_session_queue_name, maximum_player_session_count, placement_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see CreateGameSessionQueue). When
processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the
queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times
out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game
session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player
included in the request. When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each
fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's
destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session
with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions.
Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet
in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to
place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for
multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and
reorders to get the best game play across all players.  To place a new game session
request, specify the following:   The queue name and a set of game session properties and
settings   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the
status of the placement request   (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID
for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but
if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player)   Latency data for
all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)   If successful, a new game
session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call
DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request's status. If the status is FULFILLED, a
new game session has been created and a game session ARN and Region are referenced. If the
placement request times out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different

    start_match_backfill(configuration_name, players)
    start_match_backfill(configuration_name, players, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This operation can be
used to add players to matched games that start with fewer than the maximum number of
players or to replace players when they drop out. By backfilling with the same matchmaker
used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and
maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match
anytime after a game session has been created.  To request a match backfill, specify a
unique ticket ID, the existing game session's ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set
of data that describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a match
backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. The ticket is placed in
the matchmaker's ticket pool and processed. Track the status of the ticket to respond as
needed.  The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the initial
matchmaking process. The matchmaker searches the pool and groups tickets together to form
potential matches, allowing only one backfill ticket per potential match. Once the a match
is formed, the matchmaker creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in the
match are updated with the game session's connection information, and the GameSession
object is updated to include matchmaker data on the new players. For more detail on how
match backfill requests are processed, see  How Amazon GameLift FlexMatch Works.   Learn

# Arguments
- `configuration_name`: Name of the matchmaker to use for this request. You can use either
  the configuration name or ARN value. The ARN of the matchmaker that was used with the
  original game session is listed in the GameSession object, MatchmakerData property.
- `players`: Match information on all players that are currently assigned to the game
  session. This information is used by the matchmaker to find new players and add them to the
  existing game.   PlayerID, PlayerAttributes, Team -- This information is maintained in the
  GameSession object, MatchmakerData property, for all players who are currently assigned to

Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking
rules. If you're also using GameLift hosting, a new game session is started for the matched
players. Each matchmaking request identifies one or more players to find a match for, and
specifies the type of match to build, including the team configuration and the rules for an
acceptable match. When a matchmaking request identifies a group of players who want to play
together, FlexMatch finds additional players to fill the match. Match type, rules, and
other features are defined in a MatchmakingConfiguration.  To start matchmaking, provide a
unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be
matched. For each player, you must also include the player attribute values that are
required by the matchmaking configuration (in the rule set). If successful, a matchmaking
ticket is returned with status set to QUEUED.  Track the status of the ticket to respond as
needed. If you're also using GameLift hosting, a successfully completed ticket contains
game session connection information. Ticket status updates are tracked using event
notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the
matchmaking configuration.  Learn more    Add FlexMatch to a Game Client    Set Up

 This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.
Updates information about a registered game server to help GameLift FleetIQ to track game
server availability. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on
an instance in a game server group.  Use this operation to update the following types of
game server information. You can make all three types of updates in the same request:   To
update the game server's utilization status, identify the game server and game server group
and specify the current utilization status. Use this status to identify when game servers
are currently hosting games and when they are available to be claimed.   To report health
status, identify the game server and game server group and set health check to HEALTHY. If
a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server
is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered from the
game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report
health every 60 seconds.   To change game server metadata, provide updated game server
data.   Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps
are updated.  Learn more   GameLift FleetIQ Guide   Related operations

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"BalancingStrategy"`: Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances
  and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:
  SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
  unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting
  capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started,
  and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and
  are not replaced.    SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever
  available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server
  group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances.
  Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
  replaced with new On-Demand Instances.    ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are
  used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this
  balancing strategy is in force.
- `"GameServerProtectionPolicy"`: A flag that indicates whether instances in the game
  server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active
  game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be
  dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game
  servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An
  exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of
  protection status. This property is set to NO_PROTECTION by default.
- `"InstanceDefinitions"`: An updated list of EC2 instance types to use in the Auto Scaling
  group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types that are
  supported by GameLift FleetIQ. This updated list replaces the entire current list of
  instance definitions for the game server group. For more information on instance types, see
  EC2 Instance Types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. You can optionally specify capacity
  weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it
  is set to the default value \"1\". For more information about capacity weighting, see
  Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

Updates Realtime script metadata and content. To update script metadata, specify the script
ID and provide updated name and/or version values.  To update script content, provide an
updated zip file by pointing to either a local file or an Amazon S3 bucket location. You
can use either method regardless of how the original script was uploaded. Use the Version
parameter to track updates to the script. If the call is successful, the updated metadata
is stored in the script record and a revised script is uploaded to the Amazon GameLift
service. Once the script is updated and acquired by a fleet instance, the new version is
used for all new game sessions.   Learn more   Amazon GameLift Realtime Servers   Related

# Arguments
- `script_id`: A unique identifier for a Realtime script to update. You can use either the
  script ID or ARN value.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Name"`: A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do not need
  to be unique.
- `"StorageLocation"`: The Amazon S3 location of your Realtime scripts. The storage
  location must specify the S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the \"key\"), and an IAM role
  ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in
  the same Region as the script you're updating. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the
  latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the
  ObjectVersion parameter to specify an earlier version. To call this operation with a
  storage location, you must have IAM PassRole permission. For more details on IAM roles and
  PassRole permissions, see  Set up a role for GameLift access.
- `"Version"`: The version that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do
  not need to be unique.
- `"ZipFile"`: A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip
  file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB. When
  using the AWS CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It
  must be prepended with the string \"fileb://\" to indicate that the file data is a binary
  object. For example: --zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip.
