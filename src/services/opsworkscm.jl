    AssociateNode()

 Associates a new node with the server. For more information about how to disassociate a node, see DisassociateNode.  On a Chef server: This command is an alternative to knife bootstrap.  Example (Chef): aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes \"Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value=default\" \"Name=CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY,Value=public-key-pem\"   On a Puppet server, this command is an alternative to the puppet cert sign command that signs a Puppet node CSR.   Example (Puppet): aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes \"Name=PUPPET_NODE_CSR,Value=csr-pem\"   A node can can only be associated with servers that are in a HEALTHY state. Otherwise, an InvalidStateException is thrown. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A ValidationException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid. The AssociateNode API call can be integrated into Auto Scaling configurations, AWS Cloudformation templates, or the user data of a server's instance. 

# Required Parameters
- `EngineAttributes`: Engine attributes used for associating the node.   Attributes accepted in a AssociateNode request for Chef     CHEF_ORGANIZATION: The Chef organization with which the node is associated. By default only one organization named default can exist.     CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY: A PEM-formatted public key. This key is required for the chef-client agent to access the Chef API.     Attributes accepted in a AssociateNode request for Puppet     PUPPET_NODE_CSR: A PEM-formatted certificate-signing request (CSR) that is created by the node.   
- `NodeName`: The name of the node. 
- `ServerName`: The name of the server with which to associate the node.

    CreateBackup()

 Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in the BACKING_UP state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup can be created.   Backups can be created for servers in RUNNING, HEALTHY, and UNHEALTHY states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups.   This operation is asynchronous.   A LimitExceededException is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server is not found. A ValidationException is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid. 

# Required Parameters
- `ServerName`: The name of the server that you want to back up. 

# Optional Parameters
- `Description`:  A user-defined description of the backup. 
- `Tags`: A map that contains tag keys and tag values to attach to an AWS OpsWorks-CM server backup.   The key cannot be empty.   The key can be a maximum of 127 characters, and can contain only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the following special characters: + - = . _ : /    The value can be a maximum 255 characters, and contain only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the following special characters: + - = . _ : /    Leading and trailing white spaces are trimmed from both the key and value.   A maximum of 50 user-applied tags is allowed for tag-supported AWS OpsWorks-CM resources.

"""
    CreateServer()

 Creates and immedately starts a new server. The server is ready to use when it is in the HEALTHY state. By default, you can create a maximum of 10 servers.   This operation is asynchronous.   A LimitExceededException is thrown when you have created the maximum number of servers (10). A ResourceAlreadyExistsException is thrown when a server with the same name already exists in the account. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when you specify a backup ID that is not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A ValidationException is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.   If you do not specify a security group by adding the SecurityGroupIds parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group.   Chef Automate: The default security group opens the Chef server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.   Puppet Enterprise: The default security group opens TCP ports 22, 443, 4433, 8140, 8142, 8143, and 8170. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.  By default, your server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console.  To specify your own domain for a server, and provide your own self-signed or CA-signed certificate and private key, specify values for CustomDomain, CustomCertificate, and CustomPrivateKey.

# Required Parameters
- `Engine`:  The configuration management engine to use. Valid values include ChefAutomate and Puppet. 
- `InstanceProfileArn`:  The ARN of the instance profile that your Amazon EC2 instances use. Although the AWS OpsWorks console typically creates the instance profile for you, if you are using API commands instead, run the service-role-creation.yaml AWS CloudFormation template, located at https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-cm-us-east-1-prod-default-assets/misc/opsworks-cm-roles.yaml. This template creates a CloudFormation stack that includes the instance profile you need. 
- `InstanceType`:  The Amazon EC2 instance type to use. For example, m5.large. 
- `ServerName`:  The name of the server. The server name must be unique within your AWS account, within each region. Server names must start with a letter; then letters, numbers, or hyphens (-) are allowed, up to a maximum of 40 characters. 
- `ServiceRoleArn`:  The service role that the AWS OpsWorks CM service backend uses to work with your account. Although the AWS OpsWorks management console typically creates the service role for you, if you are using the AWS CLI or API commands, run the service-role-creation.yaml AWS CloudFormation template, located at https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-cm-us-east-1-prod-default-assets/misc/opsworks-cm-roles.yaml. This template creates a CloudFormation stack that includes the service role and instance profile that you need. 

# Optional Parameters
- `AssociatePublicIpAddress`:  Associate a public IP address with a server that you are launching. Valid values are true or false. The default value is true. 
- `BackupId`:  If you specify this field, AWS OpsWorks CM creates the server by using the backup represented by BackupId. 
- `BackupRetentionCount`:  The number of automated backups that you want to keep. Whenever a new backup is created, AWS OpsWorks CM deletes the oldest backups if this number is exceeded. The default value is 1. 
- `CustomCertificate`: A PEM-formatted HTTPS certificate. The value can be be a single, self-signed certificate, or a certificate chain. If you specify a custom certificate, you must also specify values for CustomDomain and CustomPrivateKey. The following are requirements for the CustomCertificate value:   You can provide either a self-signed, custom certificate, or the full certificate chain.   The certificate must be a valid X509 certificate, or a certificate chain in PEM format.   The certificate must be valid at the time of upload. A certificate can't be used before its validity period begins (the certificate's NotBefore date), or after it expires (the certificate's NotAfter date).   The certificateâ€™s common name or subject alternative names (SANs), if present, must match the value of CustomDomain.   The certificate must match the value of CustomPrivateKey.  
- `CustomDomain`: An optional public endpoint of a server, such as https://aws.my-company.com. To access the server, create a CNAME DNS record in your preferred DNS service that points the custom domain to the endpoint that is generated when the server is created (the value of the CreateServer Endpoint attribute). You cannot access the server by using the generated Endpoint value if the server is using a custom domain. If you specify a custom domain, you must also specify values for CustomCertificate and CustomPrivateKey.
- `CustomPrivateKey`: A private key in PEM format for connecting to the server by using HTTPS. The private key must not be encrypted; it cannot be protected by a password or passphrase. If you specify a custom private key, you must also specify values for CustomDomain and CustomCertificate.
- `DisableAutomatedBackup`:  Enable or disable scheduled backups. Valid values are true or false. The default value is true. 
- `EngineAttributes`: Optional engine attributes on a specified server.   Attributes accepted in a Chef createServer request:     CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY: A base64-encoded RSA public key. The corresponding private key is required to access the Chef API. When no CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY is set, a private key is generated and returned in the response.     CHEF_AUTOMATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: The password for the administrative user in the Chef Automate web-based dashboard. The password length is a minimum of eight characters, and a maximum of 32. The password can contain letters, numbers, and special characters (!/@# %^&amp;+=_). The password must contain at least one lower case letter, one upper case letter, one number, and one special character. When no CHEF_AUTOMATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD is set, one is generated and returned in the response.    Attributes accepted in a Puppet createServer request:     PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD: To work with the Puppet Enterprise console, a password must use ASCII characters.    PUPPET_R10K_REMOTE: The r10k remote is the URL of your control repository (for example, ssh://git@your.git-repo.com:user/control-repo.git). Specifying an r10k remote opens TCP port 8170.    PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY: If you are using a private Git repository, add PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY to specify a PEM-encoded private SSH key.  
- `EngineModel`:  The engine model of the server. Valid values in this release include Monolithic for Puppet and Single for Chef. 
- `EngineVersion`:  The major release version of the engine that you want to use. For a Chef server, the valid value for EngineVersion is currently 2. For a Puppet server, the valid value is 2017. 
- `KeyPair`:  The Amazon EC2 key pair to set for the instance. This parameter is optional; if desired, you may specify this parameter to connect to your instances by using SSH. 
- `PreferredBackupWindow`:  The start time for a one-hour period during which AWS OpsWorks CM backs up application-level data on your server if automated backups are enabled. Valid values must be specified in one of the following formats:     HH:MM for daily backups    DDD:HH:MM for weekly backups    MM must be specified as 00. The specified time is in coordinated universal time (UTC). The default value is a random, daily start time.  Example: 08:00, which represents a daily start time of 08:00 UTC.  Example: Mon:08:00, which represents a start time of every Monday at 08:00 UTC. (8:00 a.m.)
- `PreferredMaintenanceWindow`:  The start time for a one-hour period each week during which AWS OpsWorks CM performs maintenance on the instance. Valid values must be specified in the following format: DDD:HH:MM. MM must be specified as 00. The specified time is in coordinated universal time (UTC). The default value is a random one-hour period on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday. See TimeWindowDefinition for more information.   Example: Mon:08:00, which represents a start time of every Monday at 08:00 UTC. (8:00 a.m.) 
- `SecurityGroupIds`:  A list of security group IDs to attach to the Amazon EC2 instance. If you add this parameter, the specified security groups must be within the VPC that is specified by SubnetIds.   If you do not specify this parameter, AWS OpsWorks CM creates one new security group that uses TCP ports 22 and 443, open to 0.0.0.0/0 (everyone). 
- `SubnetIds`:  The IDs of subnets in which to launch the server EC2 instance.   Amazon EC2-Classic customers: This field is required. All servers must run within a VPC. The VPC must have \"Auto Assign Public IP\" enabled.   EC2-VPC customers: This field is optional. If you do not specify subnet IDs, your EC2 instances are created in a default subnet that is selected by Amazon EC2. If you specify subnet IDs, the VPC must have \"Auto Assign Public IP\" enabled.  For more information about supported Amazon EC2 platforms, see Supported Platforms.
- `Tags`: A map that contains tag keys and tag values to attach to an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate or AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise server.   The key cannot be empty.   The key can be a maximum of 127 characters, and can contain only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @    The value can be a maximum 255 characters, and contain only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @    Leading and trailing white spaces are trimmed from both the key and value.   A maximum of 50 user-applied tags is allowed for any AWS OpsWorks-CM server.

    RestoreServer()

 Restores a backup to a server that is in a CONNECTION_LOST, HEALTHY, RUNNING, UNHEALTHY, or TERMINATED state. When you run RestoreServer, the server's EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is configured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configuration management of the server's client devices (nodes) should continue to work.  Restoring from a backup is performed by creating a new EC2 instance. If restoration is successful, and the server is in a HEALTHY state, AWS OpsWorks CM switches traffic over to the new instance. After restoration is finished, the old EC2 instance is maintained in a Running or Stopped state, but is eventually terminated.  This operation is asynchronous.   An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server is not in a valid state. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist.

- `ResourceArn`: The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of a resource to which you want to apply tags. For example, arn:aws:opsworks-cm:us-west-2:123456789012:server/test-owcm-server/EXAMPLE-66b0-4196-8274-d1a2bEXAMPLE.
- `Tags`: A map that contains tag keys and tag values to attach to AWS OpsWorks-CM servers or backups.   The key cannot be empty.   The key can be a maximum of 127 characters, and can contain only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the following special characters: + - = . _ : /    The value can be a maximum 255 characters, and contain only Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the following special characters: + - = . _ : /    Leading and trailing white spaces are trimmed from both the key and value.   A maximum of 50 user-applied tags is allowed for any AWS OpsWorks-CM server or backup.

"""
    UpdateServerEngineAttributes()

 Updates engine-specific attributes on a specified server. The server enters the MODIFYING state when this operation is in progress. Only one update can occur at a time. You can use this command to reset a Chef server's public key (CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY) or a Puppet server's admin password (PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD).   This operation is asynchronous.   This operation can only be called for servers in HEALTHY or UNHEALTHY states. Otherwise, an InvalidStateException is raised. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A ValidationException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid. 

# Required Parameters
- `AttributeName`: The name of the engine attribute to update. 
- `ServerName`: The name of the server to update. 

# Optional Parameters
- `AttributeValue`: The value to set for the attribute.
