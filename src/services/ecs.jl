    CreateCapacityProvider()

Creates a new capacity provider. Capacity providers are associated with an Amazon ECS cluster and are used in capacity provider strategies to facilitate cluster auto scaling. Only capacity providers using an Auto Scaling group can be created. Amazon ECS tasks on AWS Fargate use the FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers which are already created and available to all accounts in Regions supported by AWS Fargate.

# Required Parameters
- `autoScalingGroupProvider`: The details of the Auto Scaling group for the capacity provider.
- `name`: The name of the capacity provider. Up to 255 characters are allowed, including letters (upper and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens. The name cannot be prefixed with \"aws\", \"ecs\", or \"fargate\".

# Optional Parameters
- `tags`: The metadata that you apply to the capacity provider to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.   Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

    CreateCluster()

Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a default cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the CreateCluster action.  When you call the CreateCluster API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the Amazon ECS service-linked role for your account so that required resources in other AWS services can be managed on your behalf. However, if the IAM user that makes the call does not have permissions to create the service-linked role, it is not created. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. 

# Optional Parameters
- `capacityProviders`: The short name of one or more capacity providers to associate with the cluster. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created and not already associated with another cluster. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.
- `clusterName`: The name of your cluster. If you do not specify a name for your cluster, you create a cluster named default. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and hyphens are allowed. 
- `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy`: The capacity provider strategy to use by default for the cluster. When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity provider or launch type is specified then the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster is used. A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. If a default capacity provider strategy is not defined for a cluster during creation, it can be defined later with the PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation.
- `settings`: The setting to use when creating a cluster. This parameter is used to enable CloudWatch Container Insights for a cluster. If this value is specified, it will override the containerInsights value set with PutAccountSetting or PutAccountSettingDefault.
- `tags`: The metadata that you apply to the cluster to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.   Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

"""
    CreateService()

Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler strategies available:    REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.    DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.   You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an UpdateService operation. The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service is using either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used, although they're currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the CreateTaskSet operation. For more information, see Amazon ECS Deployment Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the placementStrategy parameter):   Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.    

# Required Parameters
- `serviceName`: The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions.

# Optional Parameters
- `capacityProviderStrategy`: The capacity provider strategy to use for the service. A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType parameter must be omitted. If no capacityProviderStrategy or launchType is specified, the defaultCapacityProviderStrategy for the cluster is used. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.
- `clientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Up to 32 ASCII characters are allowed.
- `cluster`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to run your service. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `deploymentConfiguration`: Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
- `deploymentController`: The deployment controller to use for the service.
- `desiredCount`: The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and keep running on your cluster. This is required if schedulingStrategy is REPLICA or is not specified. If schedulingStrategy is DAEMON then this is not required.
- `enableECSManagedTags`: Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds`: The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only used when your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer defined and you don't specify a health check grace period value, the default value of 0 is used. If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
- `launchType`: The launch type on which to run your service. For more information, see Amazon ECS Launch Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If a launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter must be omitted.
- `loadBalancers`: A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If the service is using the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you can specify multiple target groups to attach to the service. The service-linked role is required for services that make use of multiple target groups. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY and associates one target group with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it. After you create a service using the ECS deployment controller, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service. For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified here. For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified here. Services with tasks that use the awsvpc network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance, because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
- `networkConfiguration`: The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `placementConstraints`: An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime). 
- `placementStrategy`: The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per service.
- `platformVersion`: The platform version that your tasks in the service are running on. A platform version is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. For more information, see AWS Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `propagateTags`: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks in the service. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks within the service during service creation. To add tags to a task after service creation, use the TagResource API action.
- `role`: The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition does not use the awsvpc network mode. If you specify the role parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the loadBalancers parameter.  If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the awsvpc network mode or if the service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you should not specify a role here. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name bar has a path of /foo/ then you would specify /foo/bar as the role name. For more information, see Friendly Names and Paths in the IAM User Guide.
- `schedulingStrategy`: The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see Services. There are two service scheduler strategies available:    REPLICA-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types.    DAEMON-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.  Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types don't support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.   
- `serviceRegistries`: The details of the service discovery registries to assign to this service. For more information, see Service Discovery.  Service discovery is supported for Fargate tasks if you are using platform version v1.1.0 or later. For more information, see AWS Fargate Platform Versions. 
- `tags`: The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as well. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.   Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.  
- `taskDefinition`: The family and revision (family:revision) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a revision is not specified, the latest ACTIVE revision is used. A task definition must be specified if the service is using the ECS deployment controller.

    DeleteService()

Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you cannot delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information, see UpdateService.  When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from ACTIVE to DRAINING, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the ListServices API operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either STOPPING or STOPPED status, the service status moves from DRAINING to INACTIVE. Services in the DRAINING or INACTIVE status can still be viewed with the DescribeServices API operation. However, in the future, INACTIVE services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and DescribeServices calls on those services return a ServiceNotFoundException error.   If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service in either ACTIVE or DRAINING status, you receive an error. 

# Required Parameters

"""
    DeregisterContainerInstance()

Deregisters an Amazon ECS container instance from the specified cluster. This instance is no longer available to run tasks. If you intend to use the container instance for some other purpose after deregistration, you should stop all of the tasks running on the container instance before deregistration. That prevents any orphaned tasks from consuming resources. Deregistering a container instance removes the instance from a cluster, but it does not terminate the EC2 instance. If you are finished using the instance, be sure to terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing.  If you terminate a running container instance, Amazon ECS automatically deregisters the instance from your cluster (stopped container instances or instances with disconnected agents are not automatically deregistered when terminated). 

# Required Parameters
- `containerInstance`: The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance to deregister. The ARN contains the arn:aws:ecs namespace, followed by the Region of the container instance, the AWS account ID of the container instance owner, the container-instance namespace, and then the container instance ID. For example, arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:container-instance/container_instance_ID.

# Optional Parameters
- `cluster`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the container instance to deregister. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `force`: Forces the deregistration of the container instance. If you have tasks running on the container instance when you deregister it with the force option, these tasks remain running until you terminate the instance or the tasks stop through some other means, but they are orphaned (no longer monitored or accounted for by Amazon ECS). If an orphaned task on your container instance is part of an Amazon ECS service, then the service scheduler starts another copy of that task, on a different container instance if possible.  Any containers in orphaned service tasks that are registered with a Classic Load Balancer or an Application Load Balancer target group are deregistered. They begin connection draining according to the settings on the load balancer or target group.

"""
    DeregisterTaskDefinition()

Deregisters the specified task definition by family and revision. Upon deregistration, the task definition is marked as INACTIVE. Existing tasks and services that reference an INACTIVE task definition continue to run without disruption. Existing services that reference an INACTIVE task definition can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count. You cannot use an INACTIVE task definition to run new tasks or create new services, and you cannot update an existing service to reference an INACTIVE task definition. However, there may be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not yet taken effect.  At this time, INACTIVE task definitions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on INACTIVE task definitions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services. 

# Required Parameters
- `taskDefinition`: The family and revision (family:revision) or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task definition to deregister. You must specify a revision.

If this parameter is not used, then ListTasks returns up to 100 results and a nextToken value if applicable.
- `nextToken`: The nextToken value returned from a ListTasks request indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls will be needed. If maxResults was provided, it is possible the number of results to be fewer than maxResults.  This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes. 
- `serviceName`: The name of the service with which to filter the ListTasks results. Specifying a serviceName limits the results to tasks that belong to that service.
- `startedBy`: The startedBy value with which to filter the task results. Specifying a startedBy value limits the results to tasks that were started with that value.

    PutAccountSetting()

Modifies an account setting. Account settings are set on a per-Region basis. If you change the account setting for the root user, the default settings for all of the IAM users and roles for which no individual account setting has been specified are reset. For more information, see Account Settings in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When serviceLongArnFormat, taskLongArnFormat, or containerInstanceLongArnFormat are specified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified IAM user, IAM role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource will be defined by the opt-in status of the IAM user or role that created the resource. You must enable this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging. When awsvpcTrunking is specified, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature is changed. If awsvpcTrunking is enabled, any new container instances that support the feature are launched have the increased ENI limits available to them. For more information, see Elastic Network Interface Trunking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When containerInsights is specified, the default setting indicating whether CloudWatch Container Insights is enabled for your clusters is changed. If containerInsights is enabled, any new clusters that are created will have Container Insights enabled unless you disable it during cluster creation. For more information, see CloudWatch Container Insights in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `name`: The Amazon ECS resource name for which to modify the account setting. If serviceLongArnFormat is specified, the ARN for your Amazon ECS services is affected.

    PutClusterCapacityProviders()

Modifies the available capacity providers and the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster. You must specify both the available capacity providers and a default capacity provider strategy for the cluster. If the specified cluster has existing capacity providers associated with it, you must specify all existing capacity providers in addition to any new ones you want to add. Any existing capacity providers associated with a cluster that are omitted from a PutClusterCapacityProviders API call will be disassociated with the cluster. You can only disassociate an existing capacity provider from a cluster if it's not being used by any existing tasks. When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity provider or launch type is specified, then the cluster's default capacity provider strategy is used. It is recommended to define a default capacity provider strategy for your cluster, however you may specify an empty array ([]) to bypass defining a default strategy.

# Required Parameters
- `capacityProviders`: The name of one or more capacity providers to associate with the cluster. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.
- `cluster`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to modify the capacity provider settings for. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy`: The capacity provider strategy to use by default for the cluster. When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity provider or launch type is specified then the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster is used. A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers.

    RegisterTaskDefinition()

Registers a new task definition from the supplied family and containerDefinitions. Optionally, you can add data volumes to your containers with the volumes parameter. For more information about task definition parameters and defaults, see Amazon ECS Task Definitions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. You can specify an IAM role for your task with the taskRoleArn parameter. When you specify an IAM role for a task, its containers can then use the latest versions of the AWS CLI or SDKs to make API requests to the AWS services that are specified in the IAM policy associated with the role. For more information, see IAM Roles for Tasks in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. You can specify a Docker networking mode for the containers in your task definition with the networkMode parameter. The available network modes correspond to those described in Network settings in the Docker run reference. If you specify the awsvpc network mode, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `containerDefinitions`: A list of container definitions in JSON format that describe the different containers that make up your task.
- `family`: You must specify a family for a task definition, which allows you to track multiple versions of the same task definition. The family is used as a name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and hyphens are allowed.

# Optional Parameters
- `cpu`: The number of CPU units used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer using CPU units, for example 1024, or as a string using vCPUs, for example 1 vCPU or 1 vcpu, in a task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the CPU units when the task definition is registered.  Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows containers.  If you are using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional. Supported values are between 128 CPU units (0.125 vCPUs) and 10240 CPU units (10 vCPUs). If you are using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range of supported values for the memory parameter:   256 (.25 vCPU) - Available memory values: 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB)   512 (.5 vCPU) - Available memory values: 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB)   1024 (1 vCPU) - Available memory values: 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB)   2048 (2 vCPU) - Available memory values: Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB)   4096 (4 vCPU) - Available memory values: Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB)  
- `executionRoleArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make AWS API calls on your behalf. The task execution IAM role is required depending on the requirements of your task. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `inferenceAccelerators`: The Elastic Inference accelerators to use for the containers in the task.
- `ipcMode`: The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are host, task, or none. If host is specified, then all containers within the tasks that specified the host IPC mode on the same container instance share the same IPC resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If task is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same IPC resources. If none is specified, then IPC resources within the containers of a task are private and not shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance. For more information, see IPC settings in the Docker run reference. If the host IPC mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired IPC namespace expose. For more information, see Docker security. If you are setting namespaced kernel parameters using systemControls for the containers in the task, the following will apply to your IPC resource namespace. For more information, see System Controls in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.   For tasks that use the host IPC mode, IPC namespace related systemControls are not supported.   For tasks that use the task IPC mode, IPC namespace related systemControls will apply to all containers within a task.    This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type. 
- `memory`: The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer using MiB, for example 1024, or as a string using GB, for example 1GB or 1 GB, in a task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the MiB when the task definition is registered.  Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows containers.  If using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional. If using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range of supported values for the cpu parameter:   512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB) - Available cpu values: 256 (.25 vCPU)   1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB) - Available cpu values: 512 (.5 vCPU)   2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) - Available cpu values: 1024 (1 vCPU)   Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 2048 (2 vCPU)   Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 4096 (4 vCPU)  
- `networkMode`: The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are none, bridge, awsvpc, and host. The default Docker network mode is bridge. If you are using the Fargate launch type, the awsvpc network mode is required. If you are using the EC2 launch type, any network mode can be used. If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.  If the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  Currently, only Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs, other Amazon Linux variants with the ecs-init package, or AWS Fargate infrastructure support the awsvpc network mode.   If the network mode is host, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used. Docker for Windows uses different network modes than Docker for Linux. When you register a task definition with Windows containers, you must not specify a network mode. If you use the console to register a task definition with Windows containers, you must choose the &lt;default&gt; network mode object.  For more information, see Network settings in the Docker run reference.
- `pidMode`: The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are host or task. If host is specified, then all containers within the tasks that specified the host PID mode on the same container instance share the same process namespace with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If task is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same process namespace. If no value is specified, the default is a private namespace. For more information, see PID settings in the Docker run reference. If the host PID mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired process namespace expose. For more information, see Docker security.  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type. 
- `placementConstraints`: An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime).
- `proxyConfiguration`: 
- `requiresCompatibilities`: The launch type required by the task. If no value is specified, it defaults to EC2.
- `tags`: The metadata that you apply to the task definition to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.

Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.  
- `taskRoleArn`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that containers in this task can assume. All containers in this task are granted the permissions that are specified in this role. For more information, see IAM Roles for Tasks in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `volumes`: A list of volume definitions in JSON format that containers in your task may use.

    RunTask()

Starts a new task using the specified task definition. You can allow Amazon ECS to place tasks for you, or you can customize how Amazon ECS places tasks using placement constraints and placement strategies. For more information, see Scheduling Tasks in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Alternatively, you can use StartTask to use your own scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances. The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command. To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:   Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time.   Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time.  

# Required Parameters
- `taskDefinition`: The family and revision (family:revision) or full ARN of the task definition to run. If a revision is not specified, the latest ACTIVE revision is used.

# Optional Parameters
- `capacityProviderStrategy`: The capacity provider strategy to use for the task. A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType parameter must be omitted. If no capacityProviderStrategy or launchType is specified, the defaultCapacityProviderStrategy for the cluster is used. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.
- `cluster`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to run your task. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `count`: The number of instantiations of the specified task to place on your cluster. You can specify up to 10 tasks per call.
- `enableECSManagedTags`: Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the task. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `group`: The name of the task group to associate with the task. The default value is the family name of the task definition (for example, family:my-family-name).
- `launchType`: The launch type on which to run your task. For more information, see Amazon ECS Launch Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If a launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter must be omitted.
- `networkConfiguration`: The network configuration for the task. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `overrides`: A list of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name of a container in the specified task definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override the default command for a container (that is specified in the task definition or Docker image) with a command override. You can also override existing environment variables (that are specified in the task definition or Docker image) on a container or add new environment variables to it with an environment override.  A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit includes the JSON formatting characters of the override structure. 
- `placementConstraints`: An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can specify up to 10 constraints per task (including constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime).
- `placementStrategy`: The placement strategy objects to use for the task. You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per task.
- `platformVersion`: The platform version the task should run. A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one is not specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. For more information, see AWS Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `propagateTags`: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the TagResource API action.  An error will be received if you specify the SERVICE option when running a task. 
- `referenceId`: The reference ID to use for the task.
- `startedBy`: An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example, if you automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique identifier for that job to your task with the startedBy parameter. You can then identify which tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a ListTasks call with the startedBy value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the startedBy parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.

A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit includes the JSON formatting characters of the override structure. 
- `propagateTags`: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the task. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated.
- `referenceId`: The reference ID to use for the task.
- `startedBy`: An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example, if you automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique identifier for that job to your task with the startedBy parameter. You can then identify which tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a ListTasks call with the startedBy value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the startedBy parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.
- `tags`: The metadata that you apply to the task to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.   Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

    StopTask()

Stops a running task. Any tags associated with the task will be deleted. When StopTask is called on a task, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM value and a default 30-second timeout, after which the SIGKILL value is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM value gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL value is sent.  The default 30-second timeout can be configured on the Amazon ECS container agent with the ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT variable. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. 

# Required Parameters
- `task`: The task ID or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task to stop.

# Optional Parameters
- `cluster`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the task to stop. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

    UpdateContainerInstancesState()

Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance. Once a container instance has reached an ACTIVE state, you can change the status of a container instance to DRAINING to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.  A container instance cannot be changed to DRAINING until it has reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received.  When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using UpdateService.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.   Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks. When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

# Required Parameters
- `containerInstances`: A list of container instance IDs or full ARN entries.
- `status`: The container instance state with which to update the container instance. The only valid values for this action are ACTIVE and DRAINING. A container instance can only be updated to DRAINING status once it has reached an ACTIVE state. If a container instance is in REGISTERING, DEREGISTERING, or REGISTRATION_FAILED state you can describe the container instance but will be unable to update the container instance state.

# Optional Parameters
- `cluster`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the container instance to update. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

    UpdateService()

 Updating the task placement strategies and constraints on an Amazon ECS service remains in preview and is a Beta Service as defined by and subject to the Beta Service Participation Service Terms located at https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms (\"Beta Terms\"). These Beta Terms apply to your participation in this preview.  Modifies the parameters of a service. For services using the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller, the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, or task definition used can be updated. For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, a new AWS CodeDeploy deployment should be created. For more information, see CreateDeployment in the AWS CodeDeploy API Reference. For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, you should create a new task set. For more information, see CreateTaskSet. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.  If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.  You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).   When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout, after which SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy):   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.     When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:    Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.  

# Required Parameters
- `service`: The name of the service to update.

# Optional Parameters
- `capacityProviderStrategy`: The capacity provider strategy to update the service to use. If the service is using the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster, the service can be updated to use one or more capacity providers as opposed to the default capacity provider strategy. However, when a service is using a capacity provider strategy that is not the default capacity provider strategy, the service cannot be updated to use the cluster's default capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created. 
- `cluster`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that your service is running on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `deploymentConfiguration`: Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
- `desiredCount`: The number of instantiations of the task to place and keep running in your service.
- `forceNewDeployment`: Whether to force a new deployment of the service. Deployments are not forced by default. You can use this option to trigger a new deployment with no service definition changes. For example, you can update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker image with the same image/tag combination (my_image:latest) or to roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version.
- `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds`: The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores the Elastic Load Balancing health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
- `networkConfiguration`: 
- `placementConstraints`: An array of task placement constraint objects to update the service to use. If no value is specified, the existing placement constraints for the service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override any existing placement constraints defined for the service. To remove all existing placement constraints, specify an empty array. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime).
- `placementStrategy`: The task placement strategy objects to update the service to use. If no value is specified, the existing placement strategy for the service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override the existing placement strategy defined for the service. To remove an existing placement strategy, specify an empty object. You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per service.
- `platformVersion`: The platform version on which your tasks in the service are running. A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If a platform version is not specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. For more information, see AWS Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `taskDefinition`: The family and revision (family:revision) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a revision is not specified, the latest ACTIVE revision is used. If you modify the task definition with UpdateService, Amazon ECS spawns a task with the new version of the task definition and then stops an old task after the new version is running.
