    create_capacity_provider(auto_scaling_group_provider, name)
    create_capacity_provider(auto_scaling_group_provider, name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new capacity provider. Capacity providers are associated with an Amazon ECS
cluster and are used in capacity provider strategies to facilitate cluster auto scaling.
Only capacity providers using an Auto Scaling group can be created. Amazon ECS tasks on AWS
Fargate use the FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers which are already created and
available to all accounts in Regions supported by AWS Fargate.

# Arguments
- `auto_scaling_group_provider`: The details of the Auto Scaling group for the capacity
  provider.
- `name`: The name of the capacity provider. Up to 255 characters are allowed, including
  letters (upper and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens. The name cannot be
  prefixed with \"aws\", \"ecs\", or \"fargate\".

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"tags"`: The metadata that you apply to the capacity provider to help you categorize and
  organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
  The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode
  characters in UTF-8   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
  resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
  Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and
  the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.   Do
  not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either
  keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values
  with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

    create_cluster()
    create_cluster(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a default cluster when
you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a
unique name with the CreateCluster action.  When you call the CreateCluster API operation,
Amazon ECS attempts to create the Amazon ECS service-linked role for your account so that
required resources in other AWS services can be managed on your behalf. However, if the IAM
user that makes the call does not have permissions to create the service-linked role, it is
not created. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the
Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"capacityProviders"`: The short name of one or more capacity providers to associate with
  the cluster. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the
  capacity provider must already be created and not already associated with another cluster.
  New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use
  a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity
  providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need
  to be associated with a cluster to be used. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation
  is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster
  is created.
- `"clusterName"`: The name of your cluster. If you do not specify a name for your cluster,
  you create a cluster named default. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers,
  and hyphens are allowed.
- `"defaultCapacityProviderStrategy"`: The capacity provider strategy to use by default for
  the cluster. When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity
  provider or launch type is specified then the default capacity provider strategy for the
  cluster is used. A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers
  along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated
  with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The
  PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.
  Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If specifying a
  capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be
  created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API
  operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or
  FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all
  accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. If a default capacity
  provider strategy is not defined for a cluster during creation, it can be defined later
  with the PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation.
- `"settings"`: The setting to use when creating a cluster. This parameter is used to
  enable CloudWatch Container Insights for a cluster. If this value is specified, it will
  override the containerInsights value set with PutAccountSetting or PutAccountSettingDefault.
- `"tags"`: The metadata that you apply to the cluster to help you categorize and organize
  them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. The
  following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
  For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
  Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode

    create_service(service_name)
    create_service(service_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the
number of tasks running in a service drops below the desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another
copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the
UpdateService action. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your
service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load
balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For
more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
Developer Guide. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy
if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are
considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and the container instance that they're
hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler
strategies available:    REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads
tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to
customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in
the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.    DAEMON - The daemon scheduling
strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the
task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also
evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not
meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a
desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.
For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container
Service Developer Guide.   You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your
service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or
the desired count of a service, with an UpdateService operation. The default value for a
replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service
for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the
minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that
must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number
of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the
DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter
enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your
service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the
scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new
tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're
in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy
if they're in the RUNNING state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The
default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service is using the ECS deployment
controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks
in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a
percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while
any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the
EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For
example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of
200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided
that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for
maximum percent is 200%. If a service is using either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL
deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy
percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the
number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container
instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch
type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used, although they're
currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the
EXTERNAL deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at
the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your
services using the CreateTaskSet operation. For more information, see Amazon ECS Deployment
Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When the service scheduler
launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:
  Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's
task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container
instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across
Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy)
with the placementStrategy parameter):   Sort the valid container instances, giving
priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in
their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and
zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are
considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container
instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container
instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.

# Arguments
- `service_name`: The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase),
  numbers, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you
  can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple
  Regions.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"capacityProviderStrategy"`: The capacity provider strategy to use for the service. A
  capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base
  and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be
  used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to
  associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or
  UPDATING status can be used. If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType
  parameter must be omitted. If no capacityProviderStrategy or launchType is specified, the
  defaultCapacityProviderStrategy for the cluster is used. If specifying a capacity provider
  that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New
  capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a
  AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity
  providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need
  to be associated with a cluster to be used. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation
  is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster
  is created.
- `"clientToken"`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request. Up to 32 ASCII characters are allowed.
- `"cluster"`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to
  run your service. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `"deploymentConfiguration"`: Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks
  run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
- `"deploymentController"`: The deployment controller to use for the service.
- `"desiredCount"`: The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place
  and keep running on your cluster. This is required if schedulingStrategy is REPLICA or is
  not specified. If schedulingStrategy is DAEMON then this is not required.
- `"enableECSManagedTags"`: Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the
  tasks within the service. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources in
  the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `"healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds"`: The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS
  service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after
  a task has first started. This is only used when your service is configured to use a load
  balancer. If your service has a load balancer defined and you don't specify a health check
  grace period value, the default value of 0 is used. If your service's tasks take a while to
  start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check
  grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS service
  scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler
  from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
- `"launchType"`: The launch type on which to run your service. For more information, see
  Amazon ECS Launch Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If a
  launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter must be omitted.
- `"loadBalancers"`: A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with
  your service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon Elastic
  Container Service Developer Guide. If the service is using the rolling update (ECS)
  deployment controller and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load
  Balancer, you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service. The
  service-linked role is required for services that make use of multiple target groups. For
  more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic
  Container Service Developer Guide. If the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment
  controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network
  Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target
  groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines
  which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY and associates one target group with
  it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load
  balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and
  an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before
  routing production traffic to it. After you create a service using the ECS deployment
  controller, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port
  specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using the CODE_DEPLOY
  deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service. For
  Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load
  balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition),
  and the container port to access from the load balancer. The load balancer name parameter
  must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the
  container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group
  specified here. For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer
  name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port
  to access from the load balancer. The target group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a
  task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is
  registered with the load balancer specified here. Services with tasks that use the awsvpc
  network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application
  Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also,
  when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the target
  type, not instance, because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an
  elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
- `"networkConfiguration"`: The network configuration for the service. This parameter is
  required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own elastic
  network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information,
  see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `"placementConstraints"`: An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in
  your service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes
  constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime).
- `"placementStrategy"`: The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service.
  You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per service.
- `"platformVersion"`: The platform version that your tasks in the service are running on.
  A platform version is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one isn't
  specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. For more information, see AWS
  Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `"propagateTags"`: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or
  the service to the tasks in the service. If no value is specified, the tags are not
  propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks within the service during service
  creation. To add tags to a task after service creation, use the TagResource API action.
- `"role"`: The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Amazon
  ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if
  you are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition does not use the
  awsvpc network mode. If you specify the role parameter, you must also specify a load
  balancer object with the loadBalancers parameter.  If your account has already created the
  Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you
  specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the
  awsvpc network mode or if the service is configured to use service discovery, an external
  deployment controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which
  case you should not specify a role here. For more information, see Using Service-Linked
  Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  If your
  specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN
  (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with
  the name bar has a path of /foo/ then you would specify /foo/bar as the role name. For more
  information, see Friendly Names and Paths in the IAM User Guide.
- `"schedulingStrategy"`: The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more
  information, see Services. There are two service scheduler strategies available:
  REPLICA-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks
  across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability
  Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
  decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY or
  EXTERNAL deployment controller types.    DAEMON-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys
  exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
  constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task
  placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement
  constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of
  tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.  Tasks using the
  Fargate launch type or the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types don't
  support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.
- `"serviceRegistries"`: The details of the service discovery registries to assign to this
  service. For more information, see Service Discovery.  Service discovery is supported for
  Fargate tasks if you are using platform version v1.1.0 or later. For more information, see
  AWS Fargate Platform Versions.
- `"tags"`: The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and organize
  them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. When a
  service is deleted, the tags are deleted as well. The following basic restrictions apply to
  tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50   For each resource, each tag key must be
  unique, and each tag key can have only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode
  characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8   If your
  tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services
  may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.   Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase
  combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use.
  You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not
  count against your tags per resource limit.
- `"taskDefinition"`: The family and revision (family:revision) or full ARN of the task
  definition to run in your service. If a revision is not specified, the latest ACTIVE
  revision is used. A task definition must be specified if the service is using either the
  ECS or CODE_DEPLOY deployment controllers.

Deletes the specified capacity provider.  The FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers

the PutClusterCapacityProviders API or by deleting the cluster.  Prior to a capacity
provider being deleted, the capacity provider must be removed from the capacity provider

instance capacity provided by the capacity provider are transitioned to use the capacity
from the remaining capacity providers. Only capacity providers that are not associated with
a cluster can be deleted. To remove a capacity provider from a cluster, you can either use
PutClusterCapacityProviders or delete the cluster.

Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if you have no
running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the service is actively
maintaining tasks, you cannot delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task
count of zero. For more information, see UpdateService.  When you delete a service, if
there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from ACTIVE to
DRAINING, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the ListServices API
operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either STOPPING or STOPPED status, the
service status moves from DRAINING to INACTIVE. Services in the DRAINING or INACTIVE status
can still be viewed with the DescribeServices API operation. However, in the future,
INACTIVE services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and
DescribeServices calls on those services return a ServiceNotFoundException error.   If you
attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service in either ACTIVE
or DRAINING status, you receive an error.

"""
    deregister_container_instance(container_instance)
    deregister_container_instance(container_instance, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deregisters an Amazon ECS container instance from the specified cluster. This instance is
no longer available to run tasks. If you intend to use the container instance for some
other purpose after deregistration, you should stop all of the tasks running on the
container instance before deregistration. That prevents any orphaned tasks from consuming
resources. Deregistering a container instance removes the instance from a cluster, but it
does not terminate the EC2 instance. If you are finished using the instance, be sure to
terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing.  If you terminate a running
container instance, Amazon ECS automatically deregisters the instance from your cluster
(stopped container instances or instances with disconnected agents are not automatically
deregistered when terminated).

# Arguments
- `container_instance`: The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance to
  deregister. The ARN contains the arn:aws:ecs namespace, followed by the Region of the
  container instance, the AWS account ID of the container instance owner, the
  container-instance namespace, and then the container instance ID. For example,
  arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:container-instance/container_instance_ID.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"cluster"`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts
  the container instance to deregister. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster
  is assumed.
- `"force"`: Forces the deregistration of the container instance. If you have tasks running
  on the container instance when you deregister it with the force option, these tasks remain
  running until you terminate the instance or the tasks stop through some other means, but
  they are orphaned (no longer monitored or accounted for by Amazon ECS). If an orphaned task
  on your container instance is part of an Amazon ECS service, then the service scheduler
  starts another copy of that task, on a different container instance if possible.  Any
  containers in orphaned service tasks that are registered with a Classic Load Balancer or an
  Application Load Balancer target group are deregistered. They begin connection draining
  according to the settings on the load balancer or target group.

Deregisters the specified task definition by family and revision. Upon deregistration, the
task definition is marked as INACTIVE. Existing tasks and services that reference an
INACTIVE task definition continue to run without disruption. Existing services that
reference an INACTIVE task definition can still scale up or down by modifying the service's
desired count. You cannot use an INACTIVE task definition to run new tasks or create new
services, and you cannot update an existing service to reference an INACTIVE task
definition. However, there may be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where
these restrictions have not yet taken effect.  At this time, INACTIVE task definitions
remain discoverable in your account indefinitely. However, this behavior is subject to
change in the future, so you should not rely on INACTIVE task definitions persisting beyond
the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services.

parameter.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"familyPrefix"`: The full family name with which to filter the ListTaskDefinitions
  results. Specifying a familyPrefix limits the listed task definitions to task definition
  revisions that belong to that family.
- `"maxResults"`: The maximum number of task definition results returned by
  ListTaskDefinitions in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ListTaskDefinitions
  only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken response element.
  The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another

- `"sort"`: The order in which to sort the results. Valid values are ASC and DESC. By
  default (ASC), task definitions are listed lexicographically by family name and in
  ascending numerical order by revision so that the newest task definitions in a family are
  listed last. Setting this parameter to DESC reverses the sort order on family name and
  revision so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed first.
- `"status"`: The task definition status with which to filter the ListTaskDefinitions
  results. By default, only ACTIVE task definitions are listed. By setting this parameter to
  INACTIVE, you can view task definitions that are INACTIVE as long as an active task or

Returns a list of tasks for a specified cluster. You can filter the results by family name,
by a particular container instance, or by the desired status of the task with the family,
containerInstance, and desiredStatus parameters. Recently stopped tasks might appear in the
returned results. Currently, stopped tasks appear in the returned results for at least one
hour.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"cluster"`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts
  the tasks to list. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `"containerInstance"`: The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance
  with which to filter the ListTasks results. Specifying a containerInstance limits the
  results to tasks that belong to that container instance.
- `"desiredStatus"`: The task desired status with which to filter the ListTasks results.
  Specifying a desiredStatus of STOPPED limits the results to tasks that Amazon ECS has set
  the desired status to STOPPED. This can be useful for debugging tasks that are not starting
  properly or have died or finished. The default status filter is RUNNING, which shows tasks
  that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to RUNNING.  Although you can filter results
  based on a desired status of PENDING, this does not return any results. Amazon ECS never
  sets the desired status of a task to that value (only a task's lastStatus may have a value
  of PENDING).
- `"family"`: The name of the family with which to filter the ListTasks results. Specifying
  a family limits the results to tasks that belong to that family.
- `"launchType"`: The launch type for services to list.
- `"maxResults"`: The maximum number of task results returned by ListTasks in paginated
  output. When this parameter is used, ListTasks only returns maxResults results in a single
  page along with a nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request
  can be seen by sending another ListTasks request with the returned nextToken value. This
  value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then ListTasks returns up to

- `"nextToken"`: The nextToken value returned from a ListTasks request indicating that more
  results are available to fulfill the request and further calls will be needed. If
  maxResults was provided, it is possible the number of results to be fewer than maxResults.
  This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next
  items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
- `"serviceName"`: The name of the service with which to filter the ListTasks results.
  Specifying a serviceName limits the results to tasks that belong to that service.
- `"startedBy"`: The startedBy value with which to filter the task results. Specifying a
  startedBy value limits the results to tasks that were started with that value.

provider strategy for the cluster. If the specified cluster has existing capacity providers
associated with it, you must specify all existing capacity providers in addition to any new
ones you want to add. Any existing capacity providers associated with a cluster that are
omitted from a PutClusterCapacityProviders API call will be disassociated with the cluster.
You can only disassociate an existing capacity provider from a cluster if it's not being
used by any existing tasks. When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no
capacity provider or launch type is specified, then the cluster's default capacity provider
strategy is used. It is recommended to define a default capacity provider strategy for your
cluster, however you may specify an empty array ([]) to bypass defining a default strategy.

# Arguments
- `capacity_providers`: The name of one or more capacity providers to associate with the
  cluster. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity
  provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the
  CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify
  either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers
  are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.

with the networkMode parameter. The available network modes correspond to those described
in Network settings in the Docker run reference. If you specify the awsvpc network mode,
the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a
NetworkConfiguration when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For
more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
Guide.

# Arguments
- `container_definitions`: A list of container definitions in JSON format that describe the
  different containers that make up your task.
- `family`: You must specify a family for a task definition, which allows you to track
  multiple versions of the same task definition. The family is used as a name for your task
  definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and hyphens are allowed.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"cpu"`: The number of CPU units used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer
  using CPU units, for example 1024, or as a string using vCPUs, for example 1 vCPU or 1
  vcpu, in a task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the CPU
  units when the task definition is registered.  Task-level CPU and memory parameters are
  ignored for Windows containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for
  Windows containers.  If you are using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional.
  Supported values are between 128 CPU units (0.125 vCPUs) and 10240 CPU units (10 vCPUs). If
  you are using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must use one of the
  following values, which determines your range of supported values for the memory parameter:
    256 (.25 vCPU) - Available memory values: 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB)   512
  (.5 vCPU) - Available memory values: 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB)

  Available memory values: Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB)
  
- `"executionRoleArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that
  grants the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make AWS API calls on your behalf. The
  task execution IAM role is required depending on the requirements of your task. For more
  information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
  Developer Guide.
- `"inferenceAccelerators"`: The Elastic Inference accelerators to use for the containers
  in the task.
- `"ipcMode"`: The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid
  values are host, task, or none. If host is specified, then all containers within the tasks
  that specified the host IPC mode on the same container instance share the same IPC
  resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If task is specified, all containers within
  the specified task share the same IPC resources. If none is specified, then IPC resources
  within the containers of a task are private and not shared with other containers in a task
  or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace
  sharing depends on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance. For more
  information, see IPC settings in the Docker run reference. If the host IPC mode is used, be
  aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired IPC namespace expose. For more
  information, see Docker security. If you are setting namespaced kernel parameters using
  systemControls for the containers in the task, the following will apply to your IPC
  resource namespace. For more information, see System Controls in the Amazon Elastic
  Container Service Developer Guide.   For tasks that use the host IPC mode, IPC namespace
  related systemControls are not supported.   For tasks that use the task IPC mode, IPC
  namespace related systemControls will apply to all containers within a task.    This
  parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type.
- `"memory"`: The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. It can be expressed as an
  integer using MiB, for example 1024, or as a string using GB, for example 1GB or 1 GB, in a
  task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the MiB when the task
  definition is registered.  Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows
  containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows containers.  If
  using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional. If using the Fargate launch type, this
  field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range
  of supported values for the cpu parameter:   512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB) -
  Available cpu values: 256 (.25 vCPU)   1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB) -
  Available cpu values: 512 (.5 vCPU)   2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB),
  6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) - Available cpu values: 1024 (1 vCPU)   Between 4096
  (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 2048 (2 vCPU)
    Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) - Available cpu
  values: 4096 (4 vCPU)
- `"networkMode"`: The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The
  valid values are none, bridge, awsvpc, and host. If no network mode is specified, the
  default is bridge. For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the awsvpc network mode is required.
  For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 instances, any network mode can be used. If the network
  mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and
  the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes
  offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network
  stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host
  and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding
  host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for
  the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.
  When using the host network mode, you should not run containers using the root user (UID
  0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root user.  If the network mode is awsvpc,
  the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a
  NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task
  definition. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container
  Service Developer Guide.  Currently, only Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs, other Amazon Linux
  variants with the ecs-init package, or AWS Fargate infrastructure support the awsvpc
  network mode.   If the network mode is host, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the
  same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used. Docker for Windows
  uses different network modes than Docker for Linux. When you register a task definition
  with Windows containers, you must not specify a network mode. If you use the console to
  register a task definition with Windows containers, you must choose the &lt;default&gt;
  network mode object.  For more information, see Network settings in the Docker run
  reference.
- `"pidMode"`: The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid
  values are host or task. If host is specified, then all containers within the tasks that
  specified the host PID mode on the same container instance share the same process namespace
  with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If task is specified, all containers within the
  specified task share the same process namespace. If no value is specified, the default is a
  private namespace. For more information, see PID settings in the Docker run reference. If
  the host PID mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired process
  namespace expose. For more information, see Docker security.  This parameter is not
  supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type.
- `"placementConstraints"`: An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task.
  You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in
  the task definition and those specified at runtime).
- `"proxyConfiguration"`:
- `"requiresCompatibilities"`: The task launch type that Amazon ECS should validate the
  task definition against. This ensures that the task definition parameters are compatible
  with the specified launch type. If no value is specified, it defaults to EC2.
- `"tags"`: The metadata that you apply to the task definition to help you categorize and
  organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
  The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode
  characters in UTF-8   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
  resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
  Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and
  the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.   Do
  not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either
  keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values
  with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
- `"taskRoleArn"`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that
  containers in this task can assume. All containers in this task are granted the permissions
  that are specified in this role. For more information, see IAM Roles for Tasks in the
  Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `"volumes"`: A list of volume definitions in JSON format that containers in your task may
  use.

    run_task(task_definition)
    run_task(task_definition, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Starts a new task using the specified task definition. You can allow Amazon ECS to place
tasks for you, or you can customize how Amazon ECS places tasks using placement constraints
and placement strategies. For more information, see Scheduling Tasks in the Amazon Elastic
Container Service Developer Guide. Alternatively, you can use StartTask to use your own
scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances. The Amazon ECS API
follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of the system
supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your
Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run.
Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API
command. To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:   Confirm the state of
the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an
exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command
to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly,
starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes
of wait time.   Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks
command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with
a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait
time.

# Arguments
- `task_definition`: The family and revision (family:revision) or full ARN of the task
  definition to run. If a revision is not specified, the latest ACTIVE revision is used.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"capacityProviderStrategy"`: The capacity provider strategy to use for the task. A
  capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base
  and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be
  used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to
  associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or
  UPDATING status can be used. If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType
  parameter must be omitted. If no capacityProviderStrategy or launchType is specified, the
  defaultCapacityProviderStrategy for the cluster is used. If specifying a capacity provider
  that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New
  capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a
  AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity
  providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need
  to be associated with a cluster to be used. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation
  is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster
  is created.
- `"cluster"`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to
  run your task. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `"count"`: The number of instantiations of the specified task to place on your cluster.
  You can specify up to 10 tasks per call.
- `"enableECSManagedTags"`: Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the
  task. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic
  Container Service Developer Guide.
- `"group"`: The name of the task group to associate with the task. The default value is
  the family name of the task definition (for example, family:my-family-name).
- `"launchType"`: The launch type on which to run your task. For more information, see
  Amazon ECS Launch Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If a
  launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter must be omitted.
- `"networkConfiguration"`: The network configuration for the task. This parameter is
  required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own elastic
  network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information,
  see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `"overrides"`: A list of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name of a
  container in the specified task definition and the overrides it should receive. You can
  override the default command for a container (that is specified in the task definition or
  Docker image) with a command override. You can also override existing environment variables
  (that are specified in the task definition or Docker image) on a container or add new
  environment variables to it with an environment override.  A total of 8192 characters are
  allowed for overrides. This limit includes the JSON formatting characters of the override
  structure.
- `"placementConstraints"`: An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task.
  You can specify up to 10 constraints per task (including constraints in the task definition
  and those specified at runtime).
- `"placementStrategy"`: The placement strategy objects to use for the task. You can
  specify a maximum of five strategy rules per task.
- `"platformVersion"`: The platform version the task should run. A platform version is only
  specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one is not specified, the LATEST
  platform version is used by default. For more information, see AWS Fargate Platform
  Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
- `"propagateTags"`: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to
  the task. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be
  propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use
  the TagResource API action.  An error will be received if you specify the SERVICE option
  when running a task.
- `"referenceId"`: The reference ID to use for the task.
- `"startedBy"`: An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example, if you
  automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique
  identifier for that job to your task with the startedBy parameter. You can then identify
  which tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a ListTasks call with the
  startedBy value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and
  underscores are allowed. If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the startedBy
  parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.
- `"tags"`: The metadata that you apply to the task to help you categorize and organize
  them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. The
  following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

    update_container_instances_state(container_instances, status)
    update_container_instances_state(container_instances, status, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance. Once a container instance has
reached an ACTIVE state, you can change the status of a container instance to DRAINING to
manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update
the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.  A container instance cannot be changed
to DRAINING until it has reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status,
an error will be received.  When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS
prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and
replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the
resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the PENDING
state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the
RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration
parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. You can change the deployment
configuration of your service using UpdateService.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below
100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For
example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two
existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler
can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for
services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING
state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in
the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by
the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number
of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch
size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks
before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required
to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until
the draining tasks have stopped.   Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a
service are not affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A
container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify
this using ListTasks. When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container
instance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can
begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

# Arguments
- `container_instances`: A list of container instance IDs or full ARN entries.
- `status`: The container instance state with which to update the container instance. The
  only valid values for this action are ACTIVE and DRAINING. A container instance can only be
  updated to DRAINING status once it has reached an ACTIVE state. If a container instance is
  in REGISTERING, DEREGISTERING, or REGISTRATION_FAILED state you can describe the container
  instance but will be unable to update the container instance state.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"cluster"`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts
  the container instance to update. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is
  assumed.

 Updating the task placement strategies and constraints on an Amazon ECS service remains in
preview and is a Beta Service as defined by and subject to the Beta Service Participation
Service Terms located at https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms (\"Beta Terms\"). These Beta
Terms apply to your participation in this preview.  Modifies the parameters of a service.
For services using the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller, the desired count,
deployment configuration, network configuration, task placement constraints and strategies,
or task definition used can be updated. For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY)
deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, task placement
constraints and strategies, and health check grace period can be updated using this API. If
the network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, a new
AWS CodeDeploy deployment should be created. For more information, see CreateDeployment in
the AWS CodeDeploy API Reference. For services using an external deployment controller, you
can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, and health
check grace period using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network
configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, you should create a
new task set. For more information, see CreateTaskSet. You can add to or subtract from the
number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that
the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. If you have updated the Docker
image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy
it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum
percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment
strategy.  If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task
definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you do not need to create a new
revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment
option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination
from your repository when they start.  You can also update the deployment configuration of
a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the
service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and
maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below
100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example,
if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing
tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are
considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load
balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance
they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent
parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment,
which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four
tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks
(provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).   When
UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to
the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout,
after which SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container
handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is
sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your
cluster with the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your
cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required
CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler
attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose
a different placement strategy):   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number
of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For
example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid
container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the
new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on
the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks
for this service.     When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to
maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:
 Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in
the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service
task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are
considered optimal for termination.   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal
Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the
largest number of running tasks for this service.

# Arguments
- `service`: The name of the service to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"capacityProviderStrategy"`: The capacity provider strategy to update the service to
  use. If the service is using the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster, the
  service can be updated to use one or more capacity providers as opposed to the default
  capacity provider strategy. However, when a service is using a capacity provider strategy
  that is not the default capacity provider strategy, the service cannot be updated to use
  the cluster's default capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy consists of
  one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity
  provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy.
  The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a
  cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If
  specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must
  already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider
  API operation. To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or
  FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers are available to all
  accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The
  PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list of available capacity
  providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.
- `"cluster"`: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that your
  service is running on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
- `"deploymentConfiguration"`: Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks
  run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
- `"desiredCount"`: The number of instantiations of the task to place and keep running in
  your service.
- `"forceNewDeployment"`: Whether to force a new deployment of the service. Deployments are
  not forced by default. You can use this option to trigger a new deployment with no service
  definition changes. For example, you can update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker
  image with the same image/tag combination (my_image:latest) or to roll Fargate tasks onto a
  newer platform version.
- `"healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds"`: The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS
  service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after
  a task has first started. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load
  balancer. If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load
  Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647
  seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores the Elastic Load
  Balancing health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from
  marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
- `"networkConfiguration"`:
- `"placementConstraints"`: An array of task placement constraint objects to update the
  service to use. If no value is specified, the existing placement constraints for the
  service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override any existing
  placement constraints defined for the service. To remove all existing placement
  constraints, specify an empty array. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task
  (this limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime).
- `"placementStrategy"`: The task placement strategy objects to update the service to use.
  If no value is specified, the existing placement strategy for the service will remain
  unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override the existing placement strategy
  defined for the service. To remove an existing placement strategy, specify an empty object.
  You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per service.
- `"platformVersion"`: The platform version on which your tasks in the service are running.
  A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If a platform
  version is not specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. For more
  information, see AWS Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
  Developer Guide.
- `"taskDefinition"`: The family and revision (family:revision) or full ARN of the task
  definition to run in your service. If a revision is not specified, the latest ACTIVE
  revision is used. If you modify the task definition with UpdateService, Amazon ECS spawns a
  task with the new version of the task definition and then stops an old task after the new
  version is running.
