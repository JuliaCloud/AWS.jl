    create_webhook(project_name)
    create_webhook(project_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

For an existing CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or
Bitbucket repository, enables CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a
code change is pushed to the repository.  If you enable webhooks for an CodeBuild project,
and the project is used as a build step in CodePipeline, then two identical builds are
created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through
CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you are billed for both builds.
Therefore, if you are using CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in
CodeBuild. In the CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more information, see step
5 in Change a Build Project's Settings.

# Arguments
- `project_name`: The name of the CodeBuild project.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"branchFilter"`: A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are
  built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression,
  then it is built. If branchFilter is empty, then all branches are built.  It is recommended
  that you use filterGroups instead of branchFilter.
- `"buildType"`: Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.
- `"filterGroups"`: An array of arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine which
  webhooks are triggered. At least one WebhookFilter in the array must specify EVENT as its
  type.  For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the filterGroups array
  must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass.
- `"manualCreation"`: If manualCreation is true, CodeBuild doesn't create a webhook in
  GitHub and instead returns payloadUrl and secret values for the webhook. The payloadUrl and
  secret values in the output can be used to manually create a webhook within GitHub.
  manualCreation is only available for GitHub webhooks.
- `"scopeConfiguration"`: The scope configuration for global or organization webhooks.
  Global or organization webhooks are only available for GitHub and Github Enterprise
  webhooks.

Starts running a build with the settings defined in the project. These setting include: how
to run a build, where to get the source code, which build environment to use, which build
commands to run, and where to store the build output. You can also start a build run by
overriding some of the build settings in the project. The overrides only apply for that
specific start build request. The settings in the project are unaltered.

# Arguments
- `project_name`: The name of the CodeBuild build project to start running a build.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"artifactsOverride"`: Build output artifact settings that override, for this build only,
  the latest ones already defined in the build project.
- `"buildStatusConfigOverride"`: Contains information that defines how the build project
  reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source
  provider is GITHUB, GITHUB_ENTERPRISE, or BITBUCKET.
- `"buildspecOverride"`: A buildspec file declaration that overrides the latest one defined
  in the build project, for this build only. The buildspec defined on the project is not
  changed. If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to
  an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR
  environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same Amazon
  Web Services Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for
  example, arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml). If this value is not provided or
  is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root
  directory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location.  Since this
  property allows you to change the build commands that will run in the container, you should
  note that an IAM principal with the ability to call this API and set this parameter can
  override the default settings. Moreover, we encourage that you use a trustworthy buildspec
  location like a file in your source repository or a Amazon S3 bucket.
- `"cacheOverride"`: A ProjectCache object specified for this build that overrides the one
  defined in the build project.
- `"certificateOverride"`: The name of a certificate for this build that overrides the one
  specified in the build project.
- `"computeTypeOverride"`: The name of a compute type for this build that overrides the one
  specified in the build project.
- `"debugSessionEnabled"`: Specifies if session debugging is enabled for this build. For
  more information, see Viewing a running build in Session Manager.
- `"encryptionKeyOverride"`: The Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) that
  overrides the one specified in the build project. The CMK key encrypts the build output
  artifacts.   You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if
  your service role has permission to that key.   You can specify either the Amazon Resource
  Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format
  alias/&lt;alias-name&gt;).
- `"environmentTypeOverride"`: A container type for this build that overrides the one
  specified in the build project.
- `"environmentVariablesOverride"`: A set of environment variables that overrides, for this
  build only, the latest ones already defined in the build project.
- `"fleetOverride"`: A ProjectFleet object specified for this build that overrides the one
  defined in the build project.
- `"gitCloneDepthOverride"`: The user-defined depth of history, with a minimum value of 0,
  that overrides, for this build only, any previous depth of history defined in the build
  project.
- `"gitSubmodulesConfigOverride"`:  Information about the Git submodules configuration for
  this build of an CodeBuild build project.
- `"idempotencyToken"`: A unique, case sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the StartBuild request. The token is included in the StartBuild request and
  is valid for 5 minutes. If you repeat the StartBuild request with the same token, but
  change a parameter, CodeBuild returns a parameter mismatch error.
- `"imageOverride"`: The name of an image for this build that overrides the one specified
  in the build project.
- `"imagePullCredentialsTypeOverride"`: The type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull
  images in your build. There are two valid values:   CODEBUILD  Specifies that CodeBuild
  uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust
  CodeBuild's service principal.  SERVICE_ROLE  Specifies that CodeBuild uses your build
  project's service role.    When using a cross-account or private registry image, you must
  use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When using an CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD
  credentials.
- `"insecureSslOverride"`: Enable this flag to override the insecure SSL setting that is
  specified in the build project. The insecure SSL setting determines whether to ignore SSL
  warnings while connecting to the project source code. This override applies only if the
  build's source is GitHub Enterprise.
- `"logsConfigOverride"`:  Log settings for this build that override the log settings
  defined in the build project.
- `"privilegedModeOverride"`: Enable this flag to override privileged mode in the build
  project.
- `"queuedTimeoutInMinutesOverride"`:  The number of minutes a build is allowed to be
  queued before it times out.
- `"registryCredentialOverride"`:  The credentials for access to a private registry.
- `"reportBuildStatusOverride"`:  Set to true to report to your source provider the status
  of a build's start and completion. If you use this option with a source provider other than
  GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket, an invalidInputException is thrown.  To be able to
  report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source
  provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the
  build status cannot be updated. For more information, see Source provider access in the
  CodeBuild User Guide.   The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to
  your source provider.
- `"secondaryArtifactsOverride"`:  An array of ProjectArtifacts objects.
- `"secondarySourcesOverride"`:  An array of ProjectSource objects.
- `"secondarySourcesVersionOverride"`:  An array of ProjectSourceVersion objects that
  specify one or more versions of the project's secondary sources to be used for this build
  only.
- `"serviceRoleOverride"`: The name of a service role for this build that overrides the one
  specified in the build project.
- `"sourceAuthOverride"`: An authorization type for this build that overrides the one
  defined in the build project. This override applies only if the build project's source is
  BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab, or GitLab Self Managed.
- `"sourceLocationOverride"`: A location that overrides, for this build, the source
  location for the one defined in the build project.
- `"sourceTypeOverride"`: A source input type, for this build, that overrides the source
  input defined in the build project.
- `"sourceVersion"`: The version of the build input to be built, for this build only. If
  not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, the contents depends on the source
  provider:  CodeCommit  The commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.  GitHub  The commit ID,
  pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source
  code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format
  pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD
  commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.  GitLab
  The commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.  Bitbucket  The commit ID, branch name, or tag
  name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name
  is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's
  HEAD commit ID is used.  Amazon S3  The version ID of the object that represents the build
  input ZIP file to use.   If sourceVersion is specified at the project level, then this
  sourceVersion (at the build level) takes precedence.  For more information, see Source
  Version Sample with CodeBuild in the CodeBuild User Guide.
- `"timeoutInMinutesOverride"`: The number of build timeout minutes, from 5 to 2160 (36
  hours), that overrides, for this build only, the latest setting already defined in the
  build project.

  CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository
  policy to trust CodeBuild's service principal.  SERVICE_ROLE  Specifies that CodeBuild uses
  your build project's service role.    When using a cross-account or private registry image,
  you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When using an CodeBuild curated image, you must use
  CODEBUILD credentials.
- `"insecureSslOverride"`: Enable this flag to override the insecure SSL setting that is
  specified in the batch build project. The insecure SSL setting determines whether to ignore
  SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code. This override applies only if the
  build's source is GitHub Enterprise.
- `"logsConfigOverride"`: A LogsConfig object that override the log settings defined in the
  batch build project.
- `"privilegedModeOverride"`: Enable this flag to override privileged mode in the batch
  build project.
- `"queuedTimeoutInMinutesOverride"`: The number of minutes a batch build is allowed to be
  queued before it times out.
- `"registryCredentialOverride"`: A RegistryCredential object that overrides credentials
  for access to a private registry.
- `"reportBuildBatchStatusOverride"`: Set to true to report to your source provider the
  status of a batch build's start and completion. If you use this option with a source
  provider other than GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket, an invalidInputException is
  thrown.   The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source
  provider.
- `"secondaryArtifactsOverride"`: An array of ProjectArtifacts objects that override the
  secondary artifacts defined in the batch build project.
- `"secondarySourcesOverride"`: An array of ProjectSource objects that override the
  secondary sources defined in the batch build project.
- `"secondarySourcesVersionOverride"`: An array of ProjectSourceVersion objects that
  override the secondary source versions in the batch build project.
- `"serviceRoleOverride"`: The name of a service role for this batch build that overrides
  the one specified in the batch build project.
- `"sourceAuthOverride"`: A SourceAuth object that overrides the one defined in the batch
  build project. This override applies only if the build project's source is BitBucket or
  GitHub.
- `"sourceLocationOverride"`: A location that overrides, for this batch build, the source
  location defined in the batch build project.
- `"sourceTypeOverride"`: The source input type that overrides the source input defined in
  the batch build project.
- `"sourceVersion"`: The version of the batch build input to be built, for this build only.
  If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, the contents depends on the
  source provider:  CodeCommit  The commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.  GitHub  The commit
  ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source
  code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format
  pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD
  commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
  Bitbucket  The commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the
  source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID
  is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.  Amazon S3  The
  version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.   If
  sourceVersion is specified at the project level, then this sourceVersion (at the build
  level) takes precedence.  For more information, see Source Version Sample with CodeBuild in
  the CodeBuild User Guide.

    update_project_visibility(project_arn, project_visibility)
    update_project_visibility(project_arn, project_visibility, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Changes the public visibility for a project. The project's build results, logs, and
artifacts are available to the general public. For more information, see Public build
projects in the CodeBuild User Guide.  The following should be kept in mind when making
your projects public:   All of a project's build results, logs, and artifacts, including
builds that were run when the project was private, are available to the general public.
All build logs and artifacts are available to the public. Environment variables, source
code, and other sensitive information may have been output to the build logs and artifacts.
You must be careful about what information is output to the build logs. Some best practice
are:   Do not store sensitive values in environment variables. We recommend that you use an
Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager to store sensitive values.
Follow Best practices for using webhooks in the CodeBuild User Guide to limit which
entities can trigger a build, and do not store the buildspec in the project itself, to
ensure that your webhooks are as secure as possible.     A malicious user can use public
builds to distribute malicious artifacts. We recommend that you review all pull requests to
verify that the pull request is a legitimate change. We also recommend that you validate
any artifacts with their checksums to make sure that the correct artifacts are being
downloaded.

# Arguments
