If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.   For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build.

"""
    CreateWebhook()

For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository.  If you enable webhooks for an AWS CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in AWS CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through AWS CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using AWS CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in AWS CodeBuild. In the AWS CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more information, see step 5 in Change a Build Project's Settings. 

# Required Parameters
- `projectName`: The name of the AWS CodeBuild project.

# Optional Parameters
- `branchFilter`: A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If branchFilter is empty, then all branches are built.  It is recommended that you use filterGroups instead of branchFilter.  
- `buildType`: Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.
- `filterGroups`: An array of arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine which webhooks are triggered. At least one WebhookFilter in the array must specify EVENT as its type.  For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the filterGroups array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass.

If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml).
