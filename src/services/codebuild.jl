    CreateWebhook()

For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository.  If you enable webhooks for an AWS CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in AWS CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through AWS CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using AWS CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in AWS CodeBuild. In the AWS CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more information, see step 5 in Change a Build Project's Settings. 

# Required Parameters
- `projectName`: The name of the AWS CodeBuild project.

# Optional Parameters
- `branchFilter`: A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If branchFilter is empty, then all branches are built.   It is recommended that you use filterGroups instead of branchFilter.  
- `filterGroups`:  An array of arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine which webhooks are triggered. At least one WebhookFilter in the array must specify EVENT as its type.   For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the filterGroups array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its filters must pass.

- `sourceTypeOverride`: A source input type, for this build, that overrides the source input defined in the build project.
- `sourceVersion`: A version of the build input to be built, for this build only. If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, must be one of:   For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.   For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.   For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.   For Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3): the version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.    If sourceVersion is specified at the project level, then this sourceVersion (at the build level) takes precedence.

    UpdateProject()

Changes the settings of a build project.

# Required Parameters
- `name`: The name of the build project.  You cannot change a build project's name. 

# Optional Parameters
- `artifacts`: Information to be changed about the build output artifacts for the build project.
- `badgeEnabled`: Set this to true to generate a publicly accessible URL for your project's build badge.
- `cache`: Stores recently used information so that it can be quickly accessed at a later time.
- `description`: A new or replacement description of the build project.
- `encryptionKey`: The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the build output artifacts.   You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key.   You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format alias/alias-name ).
- `environment`: Information to be changed about the build environment for the build project.
- `fileSystemLocations`:  An array of ProjectFileSystemLocation objects for a CodeBuild build project. A ProjectFileSystemLocation object specifies the identifier, location, mountOptions, mountPoint, and type of a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System. 
- `logsConfig`:  Information about logs for the build project. A project can create logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, logs in an S3 bucket, or both. 
- `queuedTimeoutInMinutes`:  The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before it times out. 
- `secondaryArtifacts`:  An array of ProjectSource objects. 
- `secondarySourceVersions`:  An array of ProjectSourceVersion objects. If secondarySourceVersions is specified at the build level, then they take over these secondarySourceVersions (at the project level). 
- `secondarySources`:  An array of ProjectSource objects. 
- `serviceRole`: The replacement ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that enables AWS CodeBuild to interact with dependent AWS services on behalf of the AWS account.
- `source`: Information to be changed about the build input source code for the build project.
- `sourceVersion`:  A version of the build input to be built for this project. If not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, it must be one of:    For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.   For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.   For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.   For Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3): the version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.    If sourceVersion is specified at the build level, then that version takes precedence over this sourceVersion (at the project level).   For more information, see Source Version Sample with CodeBuild in the AWS CodeBuild User Guide. 
- `tags`: An updated list of tag key and value pairs associated with this build project. These tags are available for use by AWS services that support AWS CodeBuild build project tags.
- `timeoutInMinutes`: The replacement value in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for AWS CodeBuild to wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked as completed.
- `vpcConfig`: VpcConfig enables AWS CodeBuild to access resources in an Amazon VPC.

    UpdateWebhook()

 Updates the webhook associated with an AWS CodeBuild build project.    If you use Bitbucket for your repository, rotateSecret is ignored.  

# Required Parameters
- `projectName`: The name of the AWS CodeBuild project.

# Optional Parameters
- `branchFilter`: A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If branchFilter is empty, then all branches are built.   It is recommended that you use filterGroups instead of branchFilter.  
- `filterGroups`:  An array of arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine if a webhook event can trigger a build. A filter group must contain at least one EVENT WebhookFilter.
