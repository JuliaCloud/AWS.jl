    create_application(environment_identifier, name, proxy_type, vpc_id)
    create_application(environment_identifier, name, proxy_type, vpc_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces application. The account that
owns the environment also owns the applications created inside the environment, regardless
of the account that creates the application. Refactor Spaces provisions an Amazon API
Gateway, API Gateway VPC link, and Network Load Balancer for the application proxy inside
your account.

# Arguments
- `environment_identifier`: The unique identifier of the environment.
- `name`: The name to use for the application.
- `proxy_type`: The proxy type of the proxy created within the application.
- `vpc_id`: The ID of the virtual private cloud (VPC).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ApiGatewayProxy"`: A wrapper object holding the API Gateway endpoint type and stage
  name for the proxy.
- `"ClientToken"`: A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.
- `"Tags"`: The tags to assign to the application. A tag is a label that you assign to an
  Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key-value pair.

    create_environment(name, network_fabric_type)
    create_environment(name, network_fabric_type, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces environment. The caller owns
the environment resource, and all Refactor Spaces applications, services, and routes
created within the environment. They are referred to as the environment owner. The
environment owner has cross-account visibility and control of Refactor Spaces resources
that are added to the environment by other accounts that the environment is shared with.
When creating an environment, Refactor Spaces provisions a transit gateway in your account.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the environment.
- `network_fabric_type`: The network fabric type of the environment.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientToken"`: A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the

    create_route(application_identifier, environment_identifier, route_type, service_identifier)
    create_route(application_identifier, environment_identifier, route_type, service_identifier, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces route. The account owner of
the service resource is always the environment owner, regardless of which account creates
the route. Routes target a service in the application. If an application does not have any
routes, then the first route must be created as a DEFAULT RouteType. When created, the
default route defaults to an active state so state is not a required input. However, like
all other state values the state of the default route can be updated after creation, but
only when all other routes are also inactive. Conversely, no route can be active without
the default route also being active. When you create a route, Refactor Spaces configures
the Amazon API Gateway to send traffic to the target service as follows:   If the service
has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a private IP address, Refactor Spaces
routes traffic using the API Gateway VPC link.    If the service has a URL endpoint, and
the endpoint resolves to a public IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic over the
public internet.   If the service has an Lambda function endpoint, then Refactor Spaces
configures the Lambda function's resource policy to allow the application's API Gateway to
invoke the function.   A one-time health check is performed on the service when either the
route is updated from inactive to active, or when it is created with an active state. If
the health check fails, the route transitions the route state to FAILED, an error code of
SERVICE_ENDPOINT_HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURE is provided, and no traffic is sent to the service.
For Lambda functions, the Lambda function state is checked. If the function is not active,
the function configuration is updated so that Lambda resources are provisioned. If the
Lambda state is Failed, then the route creation fails. For more information, see the
GetFunctionConfiguration's State response parameter in the Lambda Developer Guide. For
Lambda endpoints, a check is performed to determine that a Lambda function with the
specified ARN exists. If it does not exist, the health check fails. For public URLs, a
connection is opened to the public endpoint. If the URL is not reachable, the health check
fails.  For private URLS, a target group is created on the Elastic Load Balancing and the
target group health check is run. The HealthCheckProtocol, HealthCheckPort, and
HealthCheckPath are the same protocol, port, and path specified in the URL or health URL,
if used. All other settings use the default values, as described in Health checks for your
target groups. The health check is considered successful if at least one target within the
target group transitions to a healthy state. Services can have HTTP or HTTPS URL endpoints.
For HTTPS URLs, publicly-signed certificates are supported. Private Certificate Authorities
(CAs) are permitted only if the CA's domain is also publicly resolvable.

# Arguments
- `application_identifier`: The ID of the application within which the route is being
  created.
- `environment_identifier`: The ID of the environment in which the route is created.
- `route_type`: The route type of the route. DEFAULT indicates that all traffic that does
  not match another route is forwarded to the default route. Applications must have a default
  route before any other routes can be created. URI_PATH indicates a route that is based on a
  URI path.
- `service_identifier`: The ID of the service in which the route is created. Traffic that
  matches this route is forwarded to this service.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientToken"`: A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.
- `"DefaultRoute"`:  Configuration for the default route type.
- `"Tags"`: The tags to assign to the route. A tag is a label that you assign to an Amazon
  Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key-value pair..
- `"UriPathRoute"`: The configuration for the URI path route type.

Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service. The account owner of
the service is always the environment owner, regardless of which account in the environment
creates the service. Services have either a URL endpoint in a virtual private cloud (VPC),
or a Lambda function endpoint.  If an Amazon Web Services resource is launched in a service
VPC, and you want it to be accessible to all of an environment’s services with VPCs and
routes, apply the RefactorSpacesSecurityGroup to the resource. Alternatively, to add more
cross-account constraints, apply your own security group.

# Arguments
- `application_identifier`: The ID of the application which the service is created.
- `endpoint_type`: The type of endpoint to use for the service. The type can be a URL in a
  VPC or an Lambda function.
- `environment_identifier`: The ID of the environment in which the service is created.
- `name`: The name of the service.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
