    batch_execute_statement(statements)
    batch_execute_statement(statements, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 This operation allows you to perform batch reads and writes on data stored in DynamoDB,

    batch_get_item(request_items)
    batch_get_item(request_items, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The BatchGetItem operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more
tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to
16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. BatchGetItem returns a partial
result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is
exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the
operation returns a value for UnprocessedKeys. You can use this value to retry the
operation starting with the next item to get.  If you request more than 100 items,
BatchGetItem returns a ValidationException with the message \"Too many items requested for
the BatchGetItem call.\"  For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each
individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16
MB limit). It also returns an appropriate UnprocessedKeys value so you can get the next
page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the
pages of results into one dataset. If none of the items can be processed due to
insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchGetItem
returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If at least one of the items is
successfully processed, then BatchGetItem completes successfully, while returning the keys
of the unread items in UnprocessedKeys.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you
should retry the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you
use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the
underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual
tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests
in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations
and Error Handling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.  By default, BatchGetItem
performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly
consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to true for any or all tables. In
order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem retrieves items in parallel. When
designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any
particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for
the items in your request in the ProjectionExpression parameter. If a requested item does
not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the
minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. For more information, see
Working with Tables in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `request_items`: A map of one or more table names and, for each table, a map that
  describes one or more items to retrieve from that table. Each table name can be used only
  once per BatchGetItem request. Each element in the map of items to retrieve consists of the
  following:    ConsistentRead - If true, a strongly consistent read is used; if false (the
  default), an eventually consistent read is used.    ExpressionAttributeNames - One or more
  substitution tokens for attribute names in the ProjectionExpression parameter. The
  following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute
  whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating
  occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an
  attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an
  expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute
  name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
  cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see
  Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could
  specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"}    You could
  then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens
  that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for
  the actual value at runtime.  For more information about expression attribute names, see
  Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.    Keys - An array of
  primary key attribute values that define specific items in the table. For each primary key,
  you must provide all of the key attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you
  only need to provide the partition key value. For a composite key, you must provide both
  the partition key value and the sort key value.    ProjectionExpression - A string that
  identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include
  scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be
  separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes are returned.
  If any of the requested attributes are not found, they do not appear in the result. For
  more information, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
  AttributesToGet - This is a legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead. For more
  information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ReturnConsumedCapacity"`:

"""
    batch_write_item(request_items)
    batch_write_item(request_items, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single
call to BatchWriteItem can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put
or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB.
BatchWriteItem cannot update items. To update items, use the UpdateItem action.  The
individual PutItem and DeleteItem operations specified in BatchWriteItem are atomic;
however BatchWriteItem as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the
table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the
failed operations are returned in the UnprocessedItems response parameter. You can
investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call BatchWriteItem in
a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem
request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. If none of the
items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in
the request, then BatchWriteItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException.  If
DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those
items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you
retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail
due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using
exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.
For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the Amazon DynamoDB
Developer Guide.  With BatchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of
data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order
to improve performance with these large-scale operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in
the same way as individual PutItem and DeleteItem calls would. For example, you cannot
specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and BatchWriteItem does not
return deleted items in the response. If you use a programming language that supports
concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include
the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you
must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, BatchWriteItem
performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the
thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application. Parallel
processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same
number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete
operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit. If one or more of the
following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:   One or more tables
specified in the BatchWriteItem request does not exist.   Primary key attributes specified
on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key
schema.   You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same
BatchWriteItem request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same
BatchWriteItem request.     Your request contains at least two items with identical hash
and range keys (which essentially is two put operations).    There are more than 25
requests in the batch.   Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.   The total request
size exceeds 16 MB.

# Arguments
- `request_items`: A map of one or more table names and, for each table, a list of
  operations to be performed (DeleteRequest or PutRequest). Each element in the map consists
  of the following:    DeleteRequest - Perform a DeleteItem operation on the specified item.
  The item to be deleted is identified by a Key subelement:    Key - A map of primary key
  attribute values that uniquely identify the item. Each entry in this map consists of an
  attribute name and an attribute value. For each primary key, you must provide all of the
  key attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value
  for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the
  partition key and the sort key.      PutRequest - Perform a PutItem operation on the
  specified item. The item to be put is identified by an Item subelement:    Item - A map of
  attributes and their values. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute name and an
  attribute value. Attribute values must not be null; string and binary type attributes must
  have lengths greater than zero; and set type attributes must not be empty. Requests that
  contain empty values are rejected with a ValidationException exception. If you specify any
  attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must
  match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ReturnConsumedCapacity"`:
- `"ReturnItemCollectionMetrics"`: Determines whether item collection metrics are returned.

"""
    create_backup(backup_name, table_name)
    create_backup(backup_name, table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a backup for an existing table.  Each time you create an on-demand backup, the
entire table data is backed up. There is no limit to the number of on-demand backups that
can be taken.   When you create an on-demand backup, a time marker of the request is
cataloged, and the backup is created asynchronously, by applying all changes until the time
of the request to the last full table snapshot. Backup requests are processed
instantaneously and become available for restore within minutes.  You can call CreateBackup
at a maximum rate of 50 times per second. All backups in DynamoDB work without consuming
any provisioned throughput on the table.  If you submit a backup request on 2018-12-14 at
14:25:00, the backup is guaranteed to contain all data committed to the table up to
14:24:00, and data committed after 14:26:00 will not be. The backup might contain data
modifications made between 14:24:00 and 14:26:00. On-demand backup does not support causal
consistency.   Along with data, the following are also included on the backups:    Global
secondary indexes (GSIs)   Local secondary indexes (LSIs)   Streams   Provisioned read and
write capacity

# Arguments
- `backup_name`: Specified name for the backup.
- `table_name`: The name of the table.

"""
    create_global_table(global_table_name, replication_group)
    create_global_table(global_table_name, replication_group, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a global table from an existing table. A global table creates a replication
relationship between two or more DynamoDB tables with the same table name in the provided
Regions.   This operation only applies to Version 2017.11.29 of global tables.  If you want
to add a new replica table to a global table, each of the following conditions must be
true:   The table must have the same primary key as all of the other replicas.   The table
must have the same name as all of the other replicas.   The table must have DynamoDB
Streams enabled, with the stream containing both the new and the old images of the item.
None of the replica tables in the global table can contain any data.    If global secondary
indexes are specified, then the following conditions must also be met:     The global
secondary indexes must have the same name.     The global secondary indexes must have the
same hash key and sort key (if present).     If local secondary indexes are specified, then
the following conditions must also be met:     The local secondary indexes must have the
same name.     The local secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key (if
present).      Write capacity settings should be set consistently across your replica
tables and secondary indexes. DynamoDB strongly recommends enabling auto scaling to manage
the write capacity settings for all of your global tables replicas and indexes.   If you
prefer to manage write capacity settings manually, you should provision equal replicated
write capacity units to your replica tables. You should also provision equal replicated
write capacity units to matching secondary indexes across your global table.

# Arguments
- `global_table_name`: The global table name.
- `replication_group`: The Regions where the global table needs to be created.

"""
    create_table(attribute_definitions, key_schema, table_name)
    create_table(attribute_definitions, key_schema, table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The CreateTable operation adds a new table to your account. In an AWS account, table names
must be unique within each Region. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you
create the tables in different Regions.  CreateTable is an asynchronous operation. Upon
receiving a CreateTable request, DynamoDB immediately returns a response with a TableStatus
of CREATING. After the table is created, DynamoDB sets the TableStatus to ACTIVE. You can
perform read and write operations only on an ACTIVE table.  You can optionally define
secondary indexes on the new table, as part of the CreateTable operation. If you want to
create multiple tables with secondary indexes on them, you must create the tables
sequentially. Only one table with secondary indexes can be in the CREATING state at any
given time. You can use the DescribeTable action to check the table status.

# Arguments
- `attribute_definitions`: An array of attributes that describe the key schema for the
  table and indexes.
- `key_schema`: Specifies the attributes that make up the primary key for a table or an
  index. The attributes in KeySchema must also be defined in the AttributeDefinitions array.
  For more information, see Data Model in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. Each
  KeySchemaElement in the array is composed of:    AttributeName - The name of this key
  attribute.    KeyType - The role that the key attribute will assume:    HASH - partition
  key    RANGE - sort key      The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
  attribute. The term \"hash attribute\" derives from the DynamoDB usage of an internal hash
  function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key
  values. The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term \"range
  attribute\" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key
  physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.  For a simple primary key
  (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with a KeyType of HASH. For a
  composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you must provide exactly two elements,
  in this order: The first element must have a KeyType of HASH, and the second element must
  have a KeyType of RANGE. For more information, see Working with Tables in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `table_name`: The name of the table to create.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"BillingMode"`: Controls how you are charged for read and write throughput and how you
  manage capacity. This setting can be changed later.    PROVISIONED - We recommend using
  PROVISIONED for predictable workloads. PROVISIONED sets the billing mode to Provisioned
  Mode.    PAY_PER_REQUEST - We recommend using PAY_PER_REQUEST for unpredictable workloads.
  PAY_PER_REQUEST sets the billing mode to On-Demand Mode.
- `"GlobalSecondaryIndexes"`: One or more global secondary indexes (the maximum is 20) to
  be created on the table. Each global secondary index in the array includes the following:
   IndexName - The name of the global secondary index. Must be unique only for this table.
   KeySchema - Specifies the key schema for the global secondary index.    Projection -
  Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the index. These are
  in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically
  projected. Each attribute specification is composed of:    ProjectionType - One of the
  following:    KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.
  INCLUDE - Only the specified table attributes are projected into the index. The list of
  projected attributes is in NonKeyAttributes.    ALL - All of the table attributes are
  projected into the index.      NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more non-key attribute
  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total count of attributes provided
  in NonKeyAttributes, summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If
  you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct
  attributes when determining the total.      ProvisionedThroughput - The provisioned
  throughput settings for the global secondary index, consisting of read and write capacity
  units.
- `"LocalSecondaryIndexes"`: One or more local secondary indexes (the maximum is 5) to be
  created on the table. Each index is scoped to a given partition key value. There is a 10 GB
  size limit per partition key value; otherwise, the size of a local secondary index is
  unconstrained. Each local secondary index in the array includes the following:    IndexName
  - The name of the local secondary index. Must be unique only for this table.     KeySchema
  - Specifies the key schema for the local secondary index. The key schema must begin with
  the same partition key as the table.    Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied
  (projected) from the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key
  attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Each attribute
  specification is composed of:    ProjectionType - One of the following:    KEYS_ONLY - Only
  the index and primary keys are projected into the index.    INCLUDE - Only the specified
  table attributes are projected into the index. The list of projected attributes is in
  NonKeyAttributes.    ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.
  NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more non-key attribute names that are projected into
  the secondary index. The total count of attributes provided in NonKeyAttributes, summed
  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute
  into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the
  total.
- `"ProvisionedThroughput"`: Represents the provisioned throughput settings for a specified
  table or index. The settings can be modified using the UpdateTable operation.  If you set
  BillingMode as PROVISIONED, you must specify this property. If you set BillingMode as
  PAY_PER_REQUEST, you cannot specify this property. For current minimum and maximum
  provisioned throughput values, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"SSESpecification"`: Represents the settings used to enable server-side encryption.
- `"StreamSpecification"`: The settings for DynamoDB Streams on the table. These settings
  consist of:    StreamEnabled - Indicates whether DynamoDB Streams is to be enabled (true)
  or disabled (false).    StreamViewType - When an item in the table is modified,
  StreamViewType determines what information is written to the table's stream. Valid values
  for StreamViewType are:    KEYS_ONLY - Only the key attributes of the modified item are
  written to the stream.    NEW_IMAGE - The entire item, as it appears after it was modified,
  is written to the stream.    OLD_IMAGE - The entire item, as it appeared before it was
  modified, is written to the stream.    NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - Both the new and the old item
  images of the item are written to the stream.
- `"Tags"`: A list of key-value pairs to label the table. For more information, see Tagging
  for DynamoDB.

    delete_item(key, table_name)
    delete_item(key, table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deletes a single item in a table by primary key. You can perform a conditional delete
operation that deletes the item if it exists, or if it has an expected attribute value. In
addition to deleting an item, you can also return the item's attribute values in the same
operation, using the ReturnValues parameter. Unless you specify conditions, the DeleteItem
is an idempotent operation; running it multiple times on the same item or attribute does
not result in an error response. Conditional deletes are useful for deleting items only if
specific conditions are met. If those conditions are met, DynamoDB performs the delete.
Otherwise, the item is not deleted.

# Arguments
- `key`: A map of attribute names to AttributeValue objects, representing the primary key
  of the item to delete. For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For
  example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key.
  For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the partition key and the
  sort key.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

  attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size
  These function names are case-sensitive.   Comparison operators: = | &lt;&gt; | &lt; | &gt;
  | &lt;= | &gt;= | BETWEEN | IN      Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT    For more
  information about condition expressions, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB

  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ExpressionAttributeValues"`: One or more values that can be substituted in an
  expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value.
  For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus
  attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would
  first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  {
  \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"},

- `"ReturnConsumedCapacity"`:
- `"ReturnItemCollectionMetrics"`: Determines whether item collection metrics are returned.
  If set to SIZE, the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were
  modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to NONE (the default),
  no statistics are returned.
- `"ReturnValues"`: Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they
  appeared before they were deleted. For DeleteItem, the valid values are:    NONE - If
  ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is NONE, then nothing is returned. (This
  setting is the default for ReturnValues.)    ALL_OLD - The content of the old item is

    delete_table(table_name)

The DeleteTable operation deletes a table and all of its items. After a DeleteTable
request, the specified table is in the DELETING state until DynamoDB completes the
deletion. If the table is in the ACTIVE state, you can delete it. If a table is in CREATING
or UPDATING states, then DynamoDB returns a ResourceInUseException. If the specified table
does not exist, DynamoDB returns a ResourceNotFoundException. If table is already in the
DELETING state, no error is returned.   DynamoDB might continue to accept data read and
write operations, such as GetItem and PutItem, on a table in the DELETING state until the

    describe_limits()
    describe_limits(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Returns the current provisioned-capacity quotas for your AWS account in a Region, both for
the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there. When you
establish an AWS account, the account has initial quotas on the maximum read capacity units
and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a
given Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you create a table there.
For more information, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas page in the Amazon DynamoDB
Developer Guide. Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at AWS Support
Center, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The DescribeLimits action lets you
write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your
account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota. For
example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the following:   Call DescribeLimits for a
particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.
Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables
in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.   Call
ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.   For each table name listed by
ListTables, do the following:   Call DescribeTable with the table name.   Use the data
returned by DescribeTable to add the read capacity units and write capacity units
provisioned for the table itself to your variables.   If the table has one or more global
secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to
your variables as well.     Report the account quotas for that Region returned by
DescribeLimits, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have
calculated.   This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level
quotas. The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict
the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary
indexes. For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned
capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate
provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account
quotas.   DescribeLimits should only be called periodically. You can expect throttling
errors if you call it more than once in a minute.  The DescribeLimits Request element has
no content.

    get_item(key, table_name)
    get_item(key, table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The GetItem operation returns a set of attributes for the item with the given primary key.
If there is no matching item, GetItem does not return any data and there will be no Item
element in the response.  GetItem provides an eventually consistent read by default. If
your application requires a strongly consistent read, set ConsistentRead to true. Although
a strongly consistent read might take more time than an eventually consistent read, it
always returns the last updated value.

# Arguments
- `key`: A map of attribute names to AttributeValue objects, representing the primary key
  of the item to retrieve. For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For
  example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key.
  For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the partition key and the
  sort key.
- `table_name`: The name of the table containing the requested item.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AttributesToGet"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead. For
  more information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ConsistentRead"`: Determines the read consistency model: If set to true, then the
  operation uses strongly consistent reads; otherwise, the operation uses eventually
  consistent reads.
- `"ExpressionAttributeNames"`: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
  expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To
  access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a
  placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent
  special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use
  the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider
  the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a
  reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
  reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around
  this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:
  {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in
  this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression
  attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more
  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ProjectionExpression"`: A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve
  from the table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document.
  The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are
  specified, then all attributes are returned. If any of the requested attributes are not
  found, they do not appear in the result. For more information, see Specifying Item
  Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

times per second, per account. For an overview on tagging DynamoDB resources, see Tagging
for DynamoDB in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `resource_arn`: The Amazon DynamoDB resource with tags to be listed. This value is an
  Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"NextToken"`: An optional string that, if supplied, must be copied from the output of a
  previous call to ListTagOfResource. When provided in this manner, this API fetches the next
  page of results.

    put_item(item, table_name)
    put_item(item, table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same
primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely
replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if
one with the specified primary key doesn't exist), or replace an existing item if it has
certain attribute values. You can return the item's attribute values in the same operation,
using the ReturnValues parameter.  This topic provides general information about the
PutItem API. For information on how to call the PutItem API using the AWS SDK in specific
languages, see the following:     PutItem in the AWS Command Line Interface      PutItem in
the AWS SDK for .NET      PutItem in the AWS SDK for C++      PutItem in the AWS SDK for Go
     PutItem in the AWS SDK for Java      PutItem in the AWS SDK for JavaScript
PutItem in the AWS SDK for PHP V3      PutItem in the AWS SDK for Python      PutItem in
the AWS SDK for Ruby V2     When you add an item, the primary key attributes are the only
required attributes. Attribute values cannot be null. Empty String and Binary attribute
values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater
than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. Set type
attributes cannot be empty.  Invalid Requests with empty values will be rejected with a
ValidationException exception.  To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use
a conditional expression that contains the attribute_not_exists function with the name of
the attribute being used as the partition key for the table. Since every record must
contain that attribute, the attribute_not_exists function will only succeed if no matching
item exists.  For more information about PutItem, see Working with Items in the Amazon
DynamoDB Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `item`: A map of attribute name/value pairs, one for each attribute. Only the primary key
  attributes are required; you can optionally provide other attribute name-value pairs for
  the item. You must provide all of the attributes for the primary key. For example, with a
  simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite
  primary key, you must provide both values for both the partition key and the sort key. If
  you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those
  attributes must match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition. Empty String
  and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must
  have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or
  index. For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the Amazon DynamoDB
  Developer Guide. Each element in the Item map is an AttributeValue object.
- `table_name`: The name of the table to contain the item.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ConditionExpression"`: A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional
  PutItem operation to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following:   Functions:
  attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size
  These function names are case-sensitive.   Comparison operators: = | &lt;&gt; | &lt; | &gt;
  | &lt;= | &gt;= | BETWEEN | IN      Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT    For more
  information on condition expressions, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB
  Developer Guide.
- `"ConditionalOperator"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For
  more information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"Expected"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For more
  information, see Expected in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ExpressionAttributeNames"`: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
  expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To
  access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a
  placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent
  special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use
  the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider
  the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a
  reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
  reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around
  this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:
  {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in
  this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression
  attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more
  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ExpressionAttributeValues"`: One or more values that can be substituted in an
  expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value.
  For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus
  attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would
  first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  {
  \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"},
  \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} }  You could then use these values in an expression,
  such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression
  attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ReturnConsumedCapacity"`:
- `"ReturnItemCollectionMetrics"`: Determines whether item collection metrics are returned.
  If set to SIZE, the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were
  modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to NONE (the default),
  no statistics are returned.
- `"ReturnValues"`: Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they
  appeared before they were updated with the PutItem request. For PutItem, the valid values
  are:    NONE - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is NONE, then nothing is
  returned. (This setting is the default for ReturnValues.)    ALL_OLD - If PutItem overwrote
  an attribute name-value pair, then the content of the old item is returned.    The
  ReturnValues parameter is used by several DynamoDB operations; however, PutItem does not
  recognize any values other than NONE or ALL_OLD.

"""
    query(table_name)
    query(table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The Query operation finds items based on primary key values. You can query any table or
secondary index that has a composite primary key (a partition key and a sort key).  Use the
KeyConditionExpression parameter to provide a specific value for the partition key. The
Query operation will return all of the items from the table or index with that partition
key value. You can optionally narrow the scope of the Query operation by specifying a sort
key value and a comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression. To further refine the Query
results, you can optionally provide a FilterExpression. A FilterExpression determines which
items within the results should be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded.
  A Query operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found, the result
set will be empty. Queries that do not return results consume the minimum number of read
capacity units for that type of read operation.    DynamoDB calculates the number of read
capacity units consumed based on item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to
an application. The number of capacity units consumed will be the same whether you request
all of the attributes (the default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection
expression). The number will also be the same whether or not you use a FilterExpression.
Query results are always sorted by the sort key value. If the data type of the sort key is
Number, the results are returned in numeric order; otherwise, the results are returned in
order of UTF-8 bytes. By default, the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, set
the ScanIndexForward parameter to false.   A single Query operation will read up to the
maximum number of items set (if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and
then apply any filtering to the results using FilterExpression. If LastEvaluatedKey is
present in the response, you will need to paginate the result set. For more information,
see Paginating the Results in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.   FilterExpression is
applied after a Query finishes, but before the results are returned. A FilterExpression
cannot contain partition key or sort key attributes. You need to specify those attributes
in the KeyConditionExpression.    A Query operation can return an empty result set and a
LastEvaluatedKey if all the items read for the page of results are filtered out.   You can
query a table, a local secondary index, or a global secondary index. For a query on a table
or on a local secondary index, you can set the ConsistentRead parameter to true and obtain
a strongly consistent result. Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads
only, so do not specify ConsistentRead when querying a global secondary index.

# Arguments
- `table_name`: The name of the table containing the requested items.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AttributesToGet"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead. For
  more information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ConditionalOperator"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For
  more information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ConsistentRead"`: Determines the read consistency model: If set to true, then the
  operation uses strongly consistent reads; otherwise, the operation uses eventually
  consistent reads. Strongly consistent reads are not supported on global secondary indexes.
  If you query a global secondary index with ConsistentRead set to true, you will receive a
  ValidationException.
- `"ExclusiveStartKey"`: The primary key of the first item that this operation will
  evaluate. Use the value that was returned for LastEvaluatedKey in the previous operation.
  The data type for ExclusiveStartKey must be String, Number, or Binary. No set data types
  are allowed.
- `"ExpressionAttributeNames"`: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
  expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To
  access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a
  placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent
  special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use
  the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider
  the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a
  reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
  reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around
  this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:
  {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in
  this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression
  attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more
  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ExpressionAttributeValues"`: One or more values that can be substituted in an
  expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value.
  For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus
  attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would
  first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  {
  \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"},
  \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} }  You could then use these values in an expression,
  such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression
  attribute values, see Specifying Conditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"FilterExpression"`: A string that contains conditions that DynamoDB applies after the
  Query operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items that do not satisfy the
  FilterExpression criteria are not returned. A FilterExpression does not allow key
  attributes. You cannot define a filter expression based on a partition key or a sort key.
  A FilterExpression is applied after the items have already been read; the process of
  filtering does not consume any additional read capacity units.  For more information, see
  Filter Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"IndexName"`: The name of an index to query. This index can be any local secondary index
  or global secondary index on the table. Note that if you use the IndexName parameter, you
  must also provide TableName.
- `"KeyConditionExpression"`: The condition that specifies the key values for items to be
  retrieved by the Query action. The condition must perform an equality test on a single
  partition key value. The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests
  on a single sort key value. This allows Query to retrieve one item with a given partition
  key value and sort key value, or several items that have the same partition key value but
  different sort key values. The partition key equality test is required, and must be
  specified in the following format:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval  If you also want
  to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be combined using AND with the condition
  for the sort key. Following is an example, using the = comparison operator for the sort
  key:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval AND sortKeyName = :sortkeyval  Valid comparisons
  for the sort key condition are as follows:    sortKeyName = :sortkeyval - true if the sort
  key value is equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName &lt; :sortkeyval - true if the sort key
  value is less than :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName &lt;= :sortkeyval - true if the sort key
  value is less than or equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName &gt; :sortkeyval - true if the
  sort key value is greater than :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName &gt;=  :sortkeyval - true if the
  sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName BETWEEN :sortkeyval1
  AND :sortkeyval2 - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval1, and
  less than or equal to :sortkeyval2.    begins_with ( sortKeyName, :sortkeyval ) - true if
  the sort key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this function with a
  sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the function name begins_with is
  case-sensitive.   Use the ExpressionAttributeValues parameter to replace tokens such as
  :partitionval and :sortval with actual values at runtime. You can optionally use the
  ExpressionAttributeNames parameter to replace the names of the partition key and sort key
  with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with
  a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following KeyConditionExpression parameter
  causes an error because Size is a reserved word:    Size = :myval    To work around this,
  define a placeholder (such a #S) to represent the attribute name Size.
  KeyConditionExpression then is as follows:    #S = :myval    For a list of reserved words,
  see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. For more information on
  ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues, see Using Placeholders for
  Attribute Names and Values in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"KeyConditions"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use KeyConditionExpression instead. For
  more information, see KeyConditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"Limit"`: The maximum number of items to evaluate (not necessarily the number of
  matching items). If DynamoDB processes the number of items up to the limit while processing
  the results, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to that point, and a
  key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation, so that you can pick up where
  you left off. Also, if the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this
  limit, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a key in
  LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation to continue the operation. For more
  information, see Query and Scan in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ProjectionExpression"`: A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve
  from the table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document.
  The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are
  specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not
  found, they will not appear in the result. For more information, see Accessing Item
  Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"QueryFilter"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For more
  information, see QueryFilter in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ReturnConsumedCapacity"`:
- `"ScanIndexForward"`: Specifies the order for index traversal: If true (default), the
  traversal is performed in ascending order; if false, the traversal is performed in
  descending order.  Items with the same partition key value are stored in sorted order by
  sort key. If the sort key data type is Number, the results are stored in numeric order. For
  type String, the results are stored in order of UTF-8 bytes. For type Binary, DynamoDB
  treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned. If ScanIndexForward is true, DynamoDB
  returns the results in the order in which they are stored (by sort key value). This is the
  default behavior. If ScanIndexForward is false, DynamoDB reads the results in reverse order
  by sort key value, and then returns the results to the client.
- `"Select"`: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item
  attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an
  index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index.    ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns
  all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local
  secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire item
  from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all
  of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.
  ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes
  that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all
  attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES.    COUNT -
  Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves.
  SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in AttributesToGet. This return
  value is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without specifying any value for Select.
  If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected
  into that index, the operation will read only the index and not the table. If any of the
  requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches
  each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional
  throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only
  request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot
  fetch attributes from the parent table.   If neither Select nor AttributesToGet are
  specified, DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and
  ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and
  AttributesToGet together in a single request, unless the value for Select is
  SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without any
  value for Select.)  If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value for
  Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. Any other value for Select will return an error.

    scan(table_name)
    scan(table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in
a table or a secondary index. To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a
FilterExpression operation. If the total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum
dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results are returned to the user as a
LastEvaluatedKey value to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. The results also
include the number of items exceeding the limit. A scan can result in no table data meeting
the filter criteria.  A single Scan operation reads up to the maximum number of items set
(if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering to
the results using FilterExpression. If LastEvaluatedKey is present in the response, you
need to paginate the result set. For more information, see Paginating the Results in the
Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.   Scan operations proceed sequentially; however, for
faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel
Scan operation by providing the Segment and TotalSegments parameters. For more information,
see Parallel Scan in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.  Scan uses eventually consistent
reads when accessing the data in a table; therefore, the result set might not include the
changes to data in the table immediately before the operation began. If you need a
consistent copy of the data, as of the time that the Scan begins, you can set the
ConsistentRead parameter to true.

# Arguments
- `table_name`: The name of the table containing the requested items; or, if you provide
  IndexName, the name of the table to which that index belongs.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AttributesToGet"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead. For
  more information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ConditionalOperator"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For
  more information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ConsistentRead"`: A Boolean value that determines the read consistency model during the
  scan:   If ConsistentRead is false, then the data returned from Scan might not contain the
  results from other recently completed write operations (PutItem, UpdateItem, or
  DeleteItem).   If ConsistentRead is true, then all of the write operations that completed
  before the Scan began are guaranteed to be contained in the Scan response.   The default
  setting for ConsistentRead is false. The ConsistentRead parameter is not supported on
  global secondary indexes. If you scan a global secondary index with ConsistentRead set to
  true, you will receive a ValidationException.
- `"ExclusiveStartKey"`: The primary key of the first item that this operation will
  evaluate. Use the value that was returned for LastEvaluatedKey in the previous operation.
  The data type for ExclusiveStartKey must be String, Number or Binary. No set data types are
  allowed. In a parallel scan, a Scan request that includes ExclusiveStartKey must specify
  the same segment whose previous Scan returned the corresponding value of LastEvaluatedKey.
- `"ExpressionAttributeNames"`: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
  expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To
  access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a
  placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent
  special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use
  the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider
  the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a
  reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
  reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around
  this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:
  {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in
  this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression
  attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more
  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ExpressionAttributeValues"`: One or more values that can be substituted in an
  expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value.
  For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus
  attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would
  first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  {
  \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"},
  \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} }  You could then use these values in an expression,
  such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression
  attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"FilterExpression"`: A string that contains conditions that DynamoDB applies after the
  Scan operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items that do not satisfy the
  FilterExpression criteria are not returned.  A FilterExpression is applied after the items
  have already been read; the process of filtering does not consume any additional read
  capacity units.  For more information, see Filter Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB
  Developer Guide.
- `"IndexName"`: The name of a secondary index to scan. This index can be any local
  secondary index or global secondary index. Note that if you use the IndexName parameter,
  you must also provide TableName.
- `"Limit"`: The maximum number of items to evaluate (not necessarily the number of
  matching items). If DynamoDB processes the number of items up to the limit while processing
  the results, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to that point, and a
  key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation, so that you can pick up where
  you left off. Also, if the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this
  limit, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a key in
  LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation to continue the operation. For more
  information, see Working with Queries in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ProjectionExpression"`: A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve
  from the specified table or index. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements
  of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no
  attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the
  requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. For more
  information, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ReturnConsumedCapacity"`:
- `"ScanFilter"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For more
  information, see ScanFilter in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"Segment"`: For a parallel Scan request, Segment identifies an individual segment to be
  scanned by an application worker. Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first segment is
  always 0. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an
  index, then the first thread specifies a Segment value of 0, the second thread specifies 1,
  and so on. The value of LastEvaluatedKey returned from a parallel Scan request must be used
  as ExclusiveStartKey with the same segment ID in a subsequent Scan operation. The value for
  Segment must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than the value provided for
  TotalSegments. If you provide Segment, you must also provide TotalSegments.
- `"Select"`: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item
  attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an
  index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index.    ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns
  all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local
  secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire item
  from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all
  of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.
  ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes
  that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all
  attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES.    COUNT -
  Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves.
  SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in AttributesToGet. This return
  value is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without specifying any value for Select.
  If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected
  into that index, the operation reads only the index and not the table. If any of the
  requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches
  each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional
  throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only
  request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot
  fetch attributes from the parent table.   If neither Select nor AttributesToGet are
  specified, DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and
  ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and
  AttributesToGet together in a single request, unless the value for Select is
  SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without any
  value for Select.)  If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value for
  Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. Any other value for Select will return an error.
- `"TotalSegments"`: For a parallel Scan request, TotalSegments represents the total number
  of segments into which the Scan operation will be divided. The value of TotalSegments
  corresponds to the number of application workers that will perform the parallel scan. For
  example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, specify a
  TotalSegments value of 4. The value for TotalSegments must be greater than or equal to 1,
  and less than or equal to 1000000. If you specify a TotalSegments value of 1, the Scan
  operation will be sequential rather than parallel. If you specify TotalSegments, you must
  also specify Segment.

    transact_write_items(transact_items)
    transact_write_items(transact_items, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 TransactWriteItems is a synchronous write operation that groups up to 25 action requests.
These actions can target items in different tables, but not in different AWS accounts or
Regions, and no two actions can target the same item. For example, you cannot both
ConditionCheck and Update the same item. The aggregate size of the items in the transaction
cannot exceed 4 MB. The actions are completed atomically so that either all of them
succeed, or all of them fail. They are defined by the following objects:    Put  &#x97;
Initiates a PutItem operation to write a new item. This structure specifies the primary key
of the item to be written, the name of the table to write it in, an optional condition
expression that must be satisfied for the write to succeed, a list of the item's
attributes, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the
condition is not met.    Update  &#x97;   Initiates an UpdateItem operation to update an
existing item. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be updated, the name
of the table where it resides, an optional condition expression that must be satisfied for
the update to succeed, an expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, and
a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is not met.
 Delete  &#x97;   Initiates a DeleteItem operation to delete an existing item. This
structure specifies the primary key of the item to be deleted, the name of the table where
it resides, an optional condition expression that must be satisfied for the deletion to
succeed, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition
is not met.    ConditionCheck  &#x97;   Applies a condition to an item that is not being
modified by the transaction. This structure specifies the primary key of the item to be
checked, the name of the table where it resides, a condition expression that must be
satisfied for the transaction to succeed, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the
item's attributes if the condition is not met.   DynamoDB rejects the entire
TransactWriteItems request if any of the following is true:   A condition in one of the
condition expressions is not met.   An ongoing operation is in the process of updating the
same item.   There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
completed.   An item size becomes too large (bigger than 400 KB), a local secondary index
(LSI) becomes too large, or a similar validation error occurs because of changes made by
the transaction.   The aggregate size of the items in the transaction exceeds 4 MB.   There
is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

# Arguments
- `transact_items`: An ordered array of up to 25 TransactWriteItem objects, each of which
  contains a ConditionCheck, Put, Update, or Delete object. These can operate on items in
  different tables, but the tables must reside in the same AWS account and Region, and no two
  of them can operate on the same item.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: Providing a ClientRequestToken makes the call to
  TransactWriteItems idempotent, meaning that multiple identical calls have the same effect
  as one single call. Although multiple identical calls using the same client request token
  produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the responses to the calls might
  not be the same. If the ReturnConsumedCapacity&gt; parameter is set, then the initial
  TransactWriteItems call returns the amount of write capacity units consumed in making the
  changes. Subsequent TransactWriteItems calls with the same client token return the number
  of read capacity units consumed in reading the item. A client request token is valid for 10
  minutes after the first request that uses it is completed. After 10 minutes, any request
  with the same client token is treated as a new request. Do not resubmit the same request
  with the same client token for more than 10 minutes, or the result might not be idempotent.
  If you submit a request with the same client token but a change in other parameters within
  the 10-minute idempotency window, DynamoDB returns an IdempotentParameterMismatch exception.
- `"ReturnConsumedCapacity"`:
- `"ReturnItemCollectionMetrics"`: Determines whether item collection metrics are returned.
  If set to SIZE, the response includes statistics about item collections (if any), that were
  modified during the operation and are returned in the response. If set to NONE (the
  default), no statistics are returned.

# Arguments
- `key`: The primary key of the item to be updated. Each element consists of an attribute
  name and a value for that attribute. For the primary key, you must provide all of the
  attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for
  the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the
  partition key and the sort key.
- `table_name`: The name of the table containing the item to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AttributeUpdates"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use UpdateExpression instead. For more
  information, see AttributeUpdates in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ConditionExpression"`: A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional
  update to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following:   Functions:
  attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size
  These function names are case-sensitive.   Comparison operators: = | &lt;&gt; | &lt; | &gt;
  | &lt;= | &gt;= | BETWEEN | IN      Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT    For more
  information about condition expressions, see Specifying Conditions in the Amazon DynamoDB
  Developer Guide.
- `"ConditionalOperator"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For
  more information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"Expected"`: This is a legacy parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For more
  information, see Expected in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ExpressionAttributeNames"`: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
  expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To
  access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a
  placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent
  special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use
  the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider
  the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a
  reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
  reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.) To work around
  this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:
  {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in
  this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression
  attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more
  information about expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ExpressionAttributeValues"`: One or more values that can be substituted in an
  expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value.
  For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus
  attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would
  first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  {
  \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"},
  \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} }  You could then use these values in an expression,
  such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression
  attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ReturnConsumedCapacity"`:
- `"ReturnItemCollectionMetrics"`: Determines whether item collection metrics are returned.
  If set to SIZE, the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were
  modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to NONE (the default),
  no statistics are returned.
- `"ReturnValues"`: Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they appear
  before or after they are updated. For UpdateItem, the valid values are:    NONE - If
  ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is NONE, then nothing is returned. (This
  setting is the default for ReturnValues.)    ALL_OLD - Returns all of the attributes of the
  item, as they appeared before the UpdateItem operation.    UPDATED_OLD - Returns only the
  updated attributes, as they appeared before the UpdateItem operation.    ALL_NEW - Returns
  all of the attributes of the item, as they appear after the UpdateItem operation.
  UPDATED_NEW - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appear after the UpdateItem
  operation.   There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside
  from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read
  capacity units are consumed. The values returned are strongly consistent.
- `"UpdateExpression"`: An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated,
  the action to be performed on them, and new values for them. The following action values
  are available for UpdateExpression.    SET - Adds one or more attributes and values to an
  item. If any of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You
  can also use SET to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example:
  SET myNum = myNum + :val   SET supports the following functions:    if_not_exists (path,
  operand) - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then
  if_not_exists evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this
  function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.
  list_append (operand, operand) - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You
  can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of
  the operands.   These function names are case-sensitive.    REMOVE - Removes one or more
  attributes from an item.    ADD - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute
  does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on
  the data type of the attribute:   If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is
  also a number, then Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a
  negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.  If you use ADD to
  increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update,
  DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. Similarly, if you use ADD for an existing item to
  increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB
  uses 0 as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't
  have an attribute named itemcount, but you decide to ADD the number 3 to this attribute
  anyway. DynamoDB will create the itemcount attribute, set its initial value to 0, and
  finally add 3 to it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute in the item, with a value
  of 3.    If the existing data type is a set and if Value is also a set, then Value is added
  to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set [1,2], and the ADD
  action specified [3], then the final attribute value is [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an ADD
  action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the
  existing set type.  Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the
  existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings.    The ADD
  action only supports Number and set data types. In addition, ADD can only be used on
  top-level attributes, not nested attributes.     DELETE - Deletes an element from a set. If
  a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For
  example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specifies [a,c],
  then the final attribute value is [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error.  The DELETE
  action only supports set data types. In addition, DELETE can only be used on top-level
  attributes, not nested attributes.    You can have many actions in a single expression,
  such as the following: SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5  For more
  information on update expressions, see Modifying Items and Attributes in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.

    update_table(table_name)
    update_table(table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Modifies the provisioned throughput settings, global secondary indexes, or DynamoDB Streams
settings for a given table. You can only perform one of the following operations at once:
Modify the provisioned throughput settings of the table.   Enable or disable DynamoDB
Streams on the table.   Remove a global secondary index from the table.   Create a new
global secondary index on the table. After the index begins backfilling, you can use
UpdateTable to perform other operations.    UpdateTable is an asynchronous operation; while
it is executing, the table status changes from ACTIVE to UPDATING. While it is UPDATING,
you cannot issue another UpdateTable request. When the table returns to the ACTIVE state,
the UpdateTable operation is complete.

# Arguments
- `table_name`: The name of the table to be updated.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AttributeDefinitions"`: An array of attributes that describe the key schema for the
  table and indexes. If you are adding a new global secondary index to the table,
  AttributeDefinitions must include the key element(s) of the new index.
- `"BillingMode"`: Controls how you are charged for read and write throughput and how you
  manage capacity. When switching from pay-per-request to provisioned capacity, initial
  provisioned capacity values must be set. The initial provisioned capacity values are
  estimated based on the consumed read and write capacity of your table and global secondary
  indexes over the past 30 minutes.    PROVISIONED - We recommend using PROVISIONED for
  predictable workloads. PROVISIONED sets the billing mode to Provisioned Mode.
  PAY_PER_REQUEST - We recommend using PAY_PER_REQUEST for unpredictable workloads.
  PAY_PER_REQUEST sets the billing mode to On-Demand Mode.
- `"GlobalSecondaryIndexUpdates"`: An array of one or more global secondary indexes for the
  table. For each index in the array, you can request one action:    Create - add a new
  global secondary index to the table.    Update - modify the provisioned throughput settings
  of an existing global secondary index.    Delete - remove a global secondary index from the
  table.   You can create or delete only one global secondary index per UpdateTable
  operation. For more information, see Managing Global Secondary Indexes in the Amazon
  DynamoDB Developer Guide.
- `"ProvisionedThroughput"`: The new provisioned throughput settings for the specified
  table or index.
- `"ReplicaUpdates"`: A list of replica update actions (create, delete, or update) for the
  table.  This property only applies to Version 2019.11.21 of global tables.
- `"SSESpecification"`: The new server-side encryption settings for the specified table.
- `"StreamSpecification"`: Represents the DynamoDB Streams configuration for the table.
  You receive a ResourceInUseException if you try to enable a stream on a table that already
  has a stream, or if you try to disable a stream on a table that doesn't have a stream.

    update_table_replica_auto_scaling(table_name)
    update_table_replica_auto_scaling(table_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates auto scaling settings on your global tables at once.  This operation only applies
to Version 2019.11.21 of global tables.

# Arguments
- `table_name`: The name of the global table to be updated.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"GlobalSecondaryIndexUpdates"`: Represents the auto scaling settings of the global
  secondary indexes of the replica to be updated.
- `"ProvisionedWriteCapacityAutoScalingUpdate"`:

"""
    update_time_to_live(table_name, time_to_live_specification)
    update_time_to_live(table_name, time_to_live_specification, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The UpdateTimeToLive method enables or disables Time to Live (TTL) for the specified table.
A successful UpdateTimeToLive call returns the current TimeToLiveSpecification. It can take
up to one hour for the change to fully process. Any additional UpdateTimeToLive calls for
the same table during this one hour duration result in a ValidationException.  TTL compares
the current time in epoch time format to the time stored in the TTL attribute of an item.
If the epoch time value stored in the attribute is less than the current time, the item is
marked as expired and subsequently deleted.   The epoch time format is the number of
seconds elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.   DynamoDB deletes expired items on
a best-effort basis to ensure availability of throughput for other data operations.
DynamoDB typically deletes expired items within two days of expiration. The exact duration
within which an item gets deleted after expiration is specific to the nature of the
workload. Items that have expired and not been deleted will still show up in reads,
queries, and scans.  As items are deleted, they are removed from any local secondary index
and global secondary index immediately in the same eventually consistent way as a standard
delete operation. For more information, see Time To Live in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
Guide.

# Arguments
- `table_name`: The name of the table to be configured.
- `time_to_live_specification`: Represents the settings used to enable or disable Time to
  Live for the specified table.
