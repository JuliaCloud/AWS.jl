    CreateInterconnect()

Creates an interconnect between an AWS Direct Connect Partner's network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location. An interconnect is a connection that is capable of hosting other connections. The AWS Direct Connect partner can use an interconnect to provide AWS Direct Connect hosted connections to customers through their own network services. Like a standard connection, an interconnect links the partner's network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new interconnect is allocated on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is created. For each end customer, the AWS Direct Connect Partner provisions a connection on their interconnect by calling AllocateHostedConnection. The end customer can then connect to AWS resources by creating a virtual interface on their connection, using the VLAN assigned to them by the AWS Direct Connect Partner.  Intended for use by AWS Direct Connect Partners only. 

Required Parameters

"""
    CreateLag()

Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical connections between the customer network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface. All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth and must terminate at the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint. You can have up to 10 connections per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than AWS Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created. You can specify an existing physical connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical connection or hosted connections, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint to which the connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change. If the AWS account used to create a LAG is a registered AWS Direct Connect Partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces cannot be directly configured.

Required Parameters
connectionsBandwidth => The bandwidth of the individual physical connections bundled by the LAG. The possible values are 50Mbps, 100Mbps, 200Mbps, 300Mbps, 400Mbps, 500Mbps, 1Gbps, 2Gbps, 5Gbps, and 10Gbps. 
lagName => The name of the LAG.

    CreatePrivateVirtualInterface()

Creates a private virtual interface. A virtual interface is the VLAN that transports AWS Direct Connect traffic. A private virtual interface can be connected to either a Direct Connect gateway or a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW). Connecting the private virtual interface to a Direct Connect gateway enables the possibility for connecting to multiple VPCs, including VPCs in different AWS Regions. Connecting the private virtual interface to a VGW only provides access to a single VPC within the same Region. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames.
