    AdvertiseByoipCidr()

Advertises an IPv4 or IPv6 address range that is provisioned for use with your AWS resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP). You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time. We recommend that you stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR from other locations when you advertise it from AWS. To minimize down time, you can configure your AWS resources to use an address from a BYOIP CIDR before it is advertised, and then simultaneously stop advertising it from the current location and start advertising it through AWS. It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses starts routing to AWS because of BGP propagation delays. To stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR, use WithdrawByoipCidr.

# Required Parameters
- `Cidr`: The address range, in CIDR notation. This must be the exact range that you provisioned. You can't advertise only a portion of the provisioned range.

    AllocateAddress()

Allocates an Elastic IP address to your AWS account. After you allocate the Elastic IP address you can associate it with an instance or network interface. After you release an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool and can be allocated to a different AWS account. You can allocate an Elastic IP address from an address pool owned by AWS or from an address pool created from a public IPv4 address range that you have brought to AWS for use with your AWS resources using bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP). For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. [EC2-VPC] If you release an Elastic IP address, you might be able to recover it. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address that you released after it is allocated to another AWS account. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address for EC2-Classic. To attempt to recover an Elastic IP address that you released, specify it in this operation. An Elastic IP address is for use either in the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. By default, you can allocate 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-Classic per Region and 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-VPC per Region. For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. You can allocate a carrier IP address which is a public IP address from a telecommunication carrier, to a network interface which resides in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone (for example an EC2 instance). 

# Optional Parameters
- `Address`: [EC2-VPC] The Elastic IP address to recover or an IPv4 address from an address pool.
- `CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool`: The ID of a customer-owned address pool. Use this parameter to let Amazon EC2 select an address from the address pool. Alternatively, specify a specific address from the address pool.
- `Domain`: Indicates whether the Elastic IP address is for use with instances in a VPC or instances in EC2-Classic. Default: If the Region supports EC2-Classic, the default is standard. Otherwise, the default is vpc.
- `NetworkBorderGroup`:  A unique set of Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from which AWS advertises IP addresses. Use this parameter to limit the IP address to this location. IP addresses cannot move between network border groups. Use DescribeAvailabilityZones to view the network border groups.  You cannot use a network border group with EC2 Classic. If you attempt this operation on EC2 classic, you will receive an InvalidParameterCombination error. For more information, see Error Codes. 
- `PublicIpv4Pool`: The ID of an address pool that you own. Use this parameter to let Amazon EC2 select an address from the address pool. To specify a specific address from the address pool, use the Address parameter instead.

    AssociateAddress()

Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network interface. Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate it to your account. An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. [EC2-Classic, VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account] If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the specified instance. If you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing Elastic IP address, the existing address is disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated to your account. [VPC in an EC2-Classic account] If you don't specify a private IP address, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary IP address. If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance or a network interface, you get an error unless you allow reassociation. You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or network interface that has an existing Elastic IP address. [Subnets in Wavelength Zones] You can associate an IP address from the telecommunication carrier to the instance or network interface.  You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an interface in a different network border group.  This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error, and you may be charged for each time the Elastic IP address is remapped to the same instance. For more information, see the Elastic IP Addresses section of Amazon EC2 Pricing. 

# Optional Parameters
- `AllocationId`: [EC2-VPC] The allocation ID. This is required for EC2-VPC.
- `InstanceId`: The ID of the instance. This is required for EC2-Classic. For EC2-VPC, you can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but not both. The operation fails if you specify an instance ID unless exactly one network interface is attached.
- `PublicIp`: The Elastic IP address to associate with the instance. This is required for EC2-Classic.
- `allowReassociation`: [EC2-VPC] For a VPC in an EC2-Classic account, specify true to allow an Elastic IP address that is already associated with an instance or network interface to be reassociated with the specified instance or network interface. Otherwise, the operation fails. In a VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account, reassociation is automatic, therefore you can specify false to ensure the operation fails if the Elastic IP address is already associated with another resource.
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `networkInterfaceId`: [EC2-VPC] The ID of the network interface. If the instance has more than one network interface, you must specify a network interface ID. For EC2-VPC, you can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but not both. 
- `privateIpAddress`: [EC2-VPC] The primary or secondary private IP address to associate with the Elastic IP address. If no private IP address is specified, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary private IP address.

    AttachClassicLinkVpc()

Links an EC2-Classic instance to a ClassicLink-enabled VPC through one or more of the VPC's security groups. You cannot link an EC2-Classic instance to more than one VPC at a time. You can only link an instance that's in the running state. An instance is automatically unlinked from a VPC when it's stopped - you can link it to the VPC again when you restart it. After you've linked an instance, you cannot change the VPC security groups that are associated with it. To change the security groups, you must first unlink the instance, and then link it again.

For example:   Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab    Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab    Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias    Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias    AWS parses KmsKeyId asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. This action will eventually report failure.  The specified CMK must exist in the Region that the snapshot is being copied to.  Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs.

"""
    CopySnapshot()

Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can copy the snapshot within the same Region or from one Region to another. You can use the snapshot to create EBS volumes or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Copies of encrypted EBS snapshots remain encrypted. Copies of unencrypted snapshots remain unencrypted, unless you enable encryption for the snapshot copy operation. By default, encrypted snapshot copies use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK); however, you can specify a different CMK. To copy an encrypted snapshot that has been shared from another account, you must have permissions for the CMK used to encrypt the snapshot. Snapshots created by copying another snapshot have an arbitrary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose. For more information, see Copying an Amazon EBS snapshot in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `SourceRegion`: The ID of the Region that contains the snapshot to be copied.
- `SourceSnapshotId`: The ID of the EBS snapshot to copy.

# Optional Parameters
- `Description`: A description for the EBS snapshot.
- `TagSpecification`: The tags to apply to the new snapshot.
- `destinationRegion`: The destination Region to use in the PresignedUrl parameter of a snapshot copy operation. This parameter is only valid for specifying the destination Region in a PresignedUrl parameter, where it is required. The snapshot copy is sent to the regional endpoint that you sent the HTTP request to (for example, ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com). With the AWS CLI, this is specified using the --region parameter or the default Region in your AWS configuration file.
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `encrypted`: To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot if encryption by default is not enabled, enable encryption using this parameter. Otherwise, omit this parameter. Encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if you omit this parameter and encryption by default is not enabled. You cannot set this parameter to false. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
- `kmsKeyId`: The identifier of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your AWS managed CMK for EBS is used. If KmsKeyId is specified, the encrypted state must be true. You can specify the CMK using any of the following:   Key ID. For example, key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.   Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef.   Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.   AWS authenticates the CMK asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.
- `presignedUrl`: When you copy an encrypted source snapshot using the Amazon EC2 Query API, you must supply a pre-signed URL. This parameter is optional for unencrypted snapshots. For more information, see Query Requests. The PresignedUrl should use the snapshot source endpoint, the CopySnapshot action, and include the SourceRegion, SourceSnapshotId, and DestinationRegion parameters. The PresignedUrl must be signed using AWS Signature Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in Authenticating Requests by Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference. An invalid or improperly signed PresignedUrl will cause the copy operation to fail asynchronously, and the snapshot will move to an error state.

    CreateCapacityReservation()

Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes. Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This gives you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and still get the Regional RI discounts for that usage. By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to Amazon EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it. For more information, see Capacity Reservations in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if Amazon EC2 does not have sufficient capacity to fulfill the request. If your request fails due to Amazon EC2 capacity constraints, either try again at a later time, try in a different Availability Zone, or request a smaller capacity reservation. If your application is flexible across instance types and sizes, try to create a Capacity Reservation with different instance attributes. Your request could also fail if the requested quantity exceeds your On-Demand Instance limit for the selected instance type. If your request fails due to limit constraints, increase your On-Demand Instance limit for the required instance type and try again. For more information about increasing your instance limits, see Amazon EC2 Service Limits in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `InstanceCount`: The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.
- `InstancePlatform`: The type of operating system for which to reserve capacity.
- `InstanceType`: The instance type for which to reserve capacity. For more information, see Instance Types in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
- `AvailabilityZone`: The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.
- `AvailabilityZoneId`: The ID of the Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.
- `ClientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to Ensure Idempotency.
- `DryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `EbsOptimized`: Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-optimized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.
- `EndDate`: The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited. Omit EndDate if EndDateType is unlimited. If the EndDateType is limited, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.
- `EndDateType`: Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:    unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an EndDate if the EndDateType is unlimited.    limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if the EndDateType value is limited.  
- `EphemeralStorage`: Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports instances with temporary, block-level storage.
- `InstanceMatchCriteria`: Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:    open - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.    targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.    Default: open 
- `TagSpecifications`: The tags to apply to the Capacity Reservation during launch.
- `Tenancy`: Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:    default - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other AWS accounts.    dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single AWS account.

    CreateDhcpOptions()

Creates a set of DHCP options for your VPC. After creating the set, you must associate it with the VPC, causing all existing and new instances that you launch in the VPC to use this set of DHCP options. The following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information about the options, see RFC 2132.    domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. To have your instance receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in domain-name, you must set domain-name-servers to a custom DNS server.    domain-name - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in us-east-1, specify ec2.internal. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in another Region, specify region.compute.internal (for example, ap-northeast-1.compute.internal). Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, ExampleCompany.com). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. Important: Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated with a VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only one domain name.    ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.    netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.    netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more information about these node types, see RFC 2132.   Your VPC automatically starts out with a set of DHCP options that includes only a DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). If you create a set of options, and if your VPC has an internet gateway, make sure to set the domain-name-servers option either to AmazonProvidedDNS or to a domain name server of your choice.

- `ReplaceUnhealthyInstances`: Indicates whether EC2 Fleet should replace unhealthy instances.
- `SpotOptions`: Describes the configuration of Spot Instances in an EC2 Fleet.
- `TagSpecification`: The key-value pair for tagging the EC2 Fleet request on creation. The value for ResourceType must be fleet, otherwise the fleet request fails. To tag instances at launch, specify the tags in the launch template. For information about tagging after launch, see Tagging Your Resources. 
- `TerminateInstancesWithExpiration`: Indicates whether running instances should be terminated when the EC2 Fleet expires.
- `Type`: The type of the request. By default, the EC2 Fleet places an asynchronous request for your desired capacity, and maintains it by replenishing interrupted Spot Instances (maintain). A value of instant places a synchronous one-time request, and returns errors for any instances that could not be launched. A value of request places an asynchronous one-time request without maintaining capacity or submitting requests in alternative capacity pools if capacity is unavailable.

- `ClientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to Ensure Idempotency.
- `DeliverLogsPermissionArn`: The ARN for the IAM role that permits Amazon EC2 to publish flow logs to a CloudWatch Logs log group in your account. If you specify LogDestinationType as s3, do not specify DeliverLogsPermissionArn or LogGroupName.
- `DryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `LogDestination`: Specifies the destination to which the flow log data is to be published. Flow log data can be published to a CloudWatch Logs log group or an Amazon S3 bucket. The value specified for this parameter depends on the value specified for LogDestinationType. If LogDestinationType is not specified or cloud-watch-logs, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group. For example, to publish to a log group called my-logs, specify arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-logs. Alternatively, use LogGroupName instead. If LogDestinationType is s3, specify the ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket. You can also specify a subfolder in the bucket. To specify a subfolder in the bucket, use the following ARN format: bucket_ARN/subfolder_name/. For example, to specify a subfolder named my-logs in a bucket named my-bucket, use the following ARN: arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/. You cannot use AWSLogs as a subfolder name. This is a reserved term.
- `LogDestinationType`: Specifies the type of destination to which the flow log data is to be published. Flow log data can be published to CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. To publish flow log data to CloudWatch Logs, specify cloud-watch-logs. To publish flow log data to Amazon S3, specify s3. If you specify LogDestinationType as s3, do not specify DeliverLogsPermissionArn or LogGroupName. Default: cloud-watch-logs 
- `LogFormat`: The fields to include in the flow log record, in the order in which they should appear. For a list of available fields, see Flow Log Records. If you omit this parameter, the flow log is created using the default format. If you specify this parameter, you must specify at least one field. Specify the fields using the {field-id} format, separated by spaces. For the AWS CLI, use single quotation marks (' ') to surround the parameter value.
- `LogGroupName`: The name of a new or existing CloudWatch Logs log group where Amazon EC2 publishes your flow logs. If you specify LogDestinationType as s3, do not specify DeliverLogsPermissionArn or LogGroupName.
- `MaxAggregationInterval`: The maximum interval of time during which a flow of packets is captured and aggregated into a flow log record. You can specify 60 seconds (1 minute) or 600 seconds (10 minutes). When a network interface is attached to a Nitro-based instance, the aggregation interval is always 60 seconds or less, regardless of the value that you specify. Default: 600
- `TagSpecification`: The tags to apply to the flow logs.

    CreateNetworkAclEntry()

Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule number. Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules and a separate set of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet should be allowed in or out of a subnet associated with the ACL, we process the entries in the ACL according to the rule numbers, in ascending order. Each network ACL has a set of ingress rules and a separate set of egress rules. We recommend that you leave room between the rule numbers (for example, 100, 110, 120, ...), and not number them one right after the other (for example, 101, 102, 103, ...). This makes it easier to add a rule between existing ones without having to renumber the rules. After you add an entry, you can't modify it; you must either replace it, or create an entry and delete the old one. For more information about network ACLs, see Network ACLs in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `egress`: Indicates whether this is an egress rule (rule is applied to traffic leaving the subnet).
- `networkAclId`: The ID of the network ACL.
- `protocol`: The protocol number. A value of \"-1\" means all protocols. If you specify \"-1\" or a protocol number other than \"6\" (TCP), \"17\" (UDP), or \"1\" (ICMP), traffic on all ports is allowed, regardless of any ports or ICMP types or codes that you specify. If you specify protocol \"58\" (ICMPv6) and specify an IPv4 CIDR block, traffic for all ICMP types and codes allowed, regardless of any that you specify. If you specify protocol \"58\" (ICMPv6) and specify an IPv6 CIDR block, you must specify an ICMP type and code.
- `ruleAction`: Indicates whether to allow or deny the traffic that matches the rule.
- `ruleNumber`: The rule number for the entry (for example, 100). ACL entries are processed in ascending order by rule number. Constraints: Positive integer from 1 to 32766. The range 32767 to 65535 is reserved for internal use.

# Optional Parameters
- `Icmp`: ICMP protocol: The ICMP or ICMPv6 type and code. Required if specifying protocol 1 (ICMP) or protocol 58 (ICMPv6) with an IPv6 CIDR block.
- `cidrBlock`: The IPv4 network range to allow or deny, in CIDR notation (for example 172.16.0.0/24). We modify the specified CIDR block to its canonical form; for example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18, we modify it to 100.68.0.0/18.

Creates a listing for Amazon EC2 Standard Reserved Instances to be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. You can submit one Standard Reserved Instance listing at a time. To get a list of your Standard Reserved Instances, you can use the DescribeReservedInstances operation.  Only Standard Reserved Instances can be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. Convertible Reserved Instances cannot be sold.  The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell Standard Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Reserved Instances. To sell your Standard Reserved Instances, you must first register as a seller in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. After completing the registration process, you can create a Reserved Instance Marketplace listing of some or all of your Standard Reserved Instances, and specify the upfront price to receive for them. Your Standard Reserved Instance listings then become available for purchase. To view the details of your Standard Reserved Instance listing, you can use the DescribeReservedInstancesListings operation. For more information, see Reserved Instance Marketplace in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `clientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency of your listings. This helps avoid duplicate listings. For more information, see Ensuring Idempotency.
- `instanceCount`: The number of instances that are a part of a Reserved Instance account to be listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. This number should be less than or equal to the instance count associated with the Reserved Instance ID specified in this call.
- `priceSchedules`: A list specifying the price of the Standard Reserved Instance for each month remaining in the Reserved Instance term.
- `reservedInstancesId`: The ID of the active Standard Reserved Instance.

    CreateRoute()

Creates a route in a route table within a VPC. You must specify one of the following targets: internet gateway or virtual private gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, network interface, egress-only internet gateway, or transit gateway. When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address 192.0.2.3, and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:    192.0.2.0/24 (goes to some target A)    192.0.2.0/28 (goes to some target B)   Both routes apply to the traffic destined for 192.0.2.3. However, the second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is therefore more specific, so we use that route to determine where to target the traffic. For more information about route tables, see Route Tables in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `routeTableId`: The ID of the route table for the route.

# Optional Parameters
- `CarrierGatewayId`: The ID of the carrier gateway. You can only use this option when the VPC contains a subnet which is associated with a Wavelength Zone.
- `DestinationPrefixListId`: The ID of a prefix list used for the destination match.
- `LocalGatewayId`: The ID of the local gateway.
- `TransitGatewayId`: The ID of a transit gateway.
- `destinationCidrBlock`: The IPv4 CIDR address block used for the destination match. Routing decisions are based on the most specific match. We modify the specified CIDR block to its canonical form; for example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18, we modify it to 100.68.0.0/18.
- `destinationIpv6CidrBlock`: The IPv6 CIDR block used for the destination match. Routing decisions are based on the most specific match.
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `egressOnlyInternetGatewayId`: [IPv6 traffic only] The ID of an egress-only internet gateway.
- `gatewayId`: The ID of an internet gateway or virtual private gateway attached to your VPC.
- `instanceId`: The ID of a NAT instance in your VPC. The operation fails if you specify an instance ID unless exactly one network interface is attached.

    CreateSecurityGroup()

Creates a security group. A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Security Groups in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide and Security Groups for Your VPC in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide. When you create a security group, you specify a friendly name of your choice. You can have a security group for use in EC2-Classic with the same name as a security group for use in a VPC. However, you can't have two security groups for use in EC2-Classic with the same name or two security groups for use in a VPC with the same name. You have a default security group for use in EC2-Classic and a default security group for use in your VPC. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into the appropriate default security group. A default security group includes a default rule that grants instances unrestricted network access to each other. You can add or remove rules from your security groups using AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress, AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress, RevokeSecurityGroupIngress, and RevokeSecurityGroupEgress. For more information about VPC security group limits, see Amazon VPC Limits.

# Required Parameters

    CreateSnapshot()

Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an instance. When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot. You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending. To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot. Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected. You can tag your snapshots during creation. For more information, see Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. For more information, see Amazon Elastic Block Store and Amazon EBS Encryption in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters

"""
    CreateSubnet()

Creates a subnet in a specified VPC. You must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet. After you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block. The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses). The CIDR block must not overlap with the CIDR block of an existing subnet in the VPC. If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can create a subnet with an IPv6 CIDR block that uses a /64 prefix length.   AWS reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use.  If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle. When you stop an instance in a subnet, it retains its private IPv4 address. It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available. For more information about subnets, see Your VPC and Subnets in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `CidrBlock`: The IPv4 network range for the subnet, in CIDR notation. For example, 10.0.0.0/24. We modify the specified CIDR block to its canonical form; for example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18, we modify it to 100.68.0.0/18.
- `VpcId`: The ID of the VPC.

# Optional Parameters
- `AvailabilityZone`: The Availability Zone or Local Zone for the subnet. Default: AWS selects one for you. If you create more than one subnet in your VPC, we do not necessarily select a different zone for each subnet. To create a subnet in a Local Zone, set this value to the Local Zone ID, for example us-west-2-lax-1a. For information about the Regions that support Local Zones, see Available Regions in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. To create a subnet in an Outpost, set this value to the Availability Zone for the Outpost and specify the Outpost ARN.
- `AvailabilityZoneId`: The AZ ID or the Local Zone ID of the subnet.
- `Ipv6CidrBlock`: The IPv6 network range for the subnet, in CIDR notation. The subnet size must use a /64 prefix length.
- `OutpostArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost. If you specify an Outpost ARN, you must also specify the Availability Zone of the Outpost subnet.
- `TagSpecification`: The tags to assign to the subnet.

    CreateVolume()

Creates an EBS volume that can be attached to an instance in the same Availability Zone. The volume is created in the regional endpoint that you send the HTTP request to. For more information see Regions and Endpoints. You can create a new empty volume or restore a volume from an EBS snapshot. Any AWS Marketplace product codes from the snapshot are propagated to the volume. You can create encrypted volumes. Encrypted volumes must be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. You can tag your volumes during creation. For more information, see Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. For more information, see Creating an Amazon EBS volume in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `AvailabilityZone`: The Availability Zone in which to create the volume.

# Optional Parameters
- `Iops`: The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) to provision for an io1 or io2 volume, with a maximum ratio of 50 IOPS/GiB for io1, and 500 IOPS/GiB for io2. Range is 100 to 64,000 IOPS for volumes in most Regions. Maximum IOPS of 64,000 is guaranteed only on Nitro-based instances. Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS. For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. This parameter is valid only for Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2) volumes.
- `KmsKeyId`: The identifier of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your AWS managed CMK for EBS is used. If KmsKeyId is specified, the encrypted state must be true. You can specify the CMK using any of the following:   Key ID. For example, key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.   Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef.   Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.   AWS authenticates the CMK asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.
- `MultiAttachEnabled`: Specifies whether to enable Amazon EBS Multi-Attach. If you enable Multi-Attach, you can attach the volume to up to 16 Nitro-based instances in the same Availability Zone. For more information, see  Amazon EBS Multi-Attach in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
- `OutpostArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.
- `Size`: The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. Constraints: 1-16,384 for gp2, 4-16,384 for io1 and io2, 500-16,384 for st1, 500-16,384 for sc1, and 1-1,024 for standard. If you specify a snapshot, the volume size must be equal to or larger than the snapshot size. Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot and don't specify a volume size, the default is the snapshot size.
- `SnapshotId`: The snapshot from which to create the volume. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size.
- `TagSpecification`: The tags to apply to the volume during creation.
- `VolumeType`: The volume type. This can be gp2 for General Purpose SSD, io1 or io2 for Provisioned IOPS SSD, st1 for Throughput Optimized HDD, sc1 for Cold HDD, or standard for Magnetic volumes. Default: gp2 
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `encrypted`: Specifies whether the volume should be encrypted. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see Encryption by default in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. Encrypted Amazon EBS volumes must be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Supported instance types.

    CreateVpc()

Creates a VPC with the specified IPv4 CIDR block. The smallest VPC you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IPv4 addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IPv4 addresses). For more information about how large to make your VPC, see Your VPC and Subnets in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide. You can optionally request an IPv6 CIDR block for the VPC. You can request an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses, or an IPv6 CIDR block from an IPv6 address pool that you provisioned through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP). By default, each instance you launch in the VPC has the default DHCP options, which include only a default DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). For more information, see DHCP Options Sets in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide. You can specify the instance tenancy value for the VPC when you create it. You can't change this value for the VPC after you create it. For more information, see Dedicated Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `CidrBlock`: The IPv4 network range for the VPC, in CIDR notation. For example, 10.0.0.0/16. We modify the specified CIDR block to its canonical form; for example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18, we modify it to 100.68.0.0/18.

# Optional Parameters
- `Ipv6CidrBlock`: The IPv6 CIDR block from the IPv6 address pool. You must also specify Ipv6Pool in the request. To let Amazon choose the IPv6 CIDR block for you, omit this parameter.
- `Ipv6CidrBlockNetworkBorderGroup`: The name of the location from which we advertise the IPV6 CIDR block. Use this parameter to limit the address to this location.  You must set AmazonProvidedIpv6CidrBlock to true to use this parameter.
- `Ipv6Pool`: The ID of an IPv6 address pool from which to allocate the IPv6 CIDR block.
- `TagSpecification`: The tags to assign to the VPC.
- `amazonProvidedIpv6CidrBlock`: Requests an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block with a /56 prefix length for the VPC. You cannot specify the range of IP addresses, or the size of the CIDR block.

    CreateVpcEndpoint()

Creates a VPC endpoint for a specified service. An endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and the service. The service may be provided by AWS, an AWS Marketplace Partner, or another AWS account. For more information, see VPC Endpoints in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide. A gateway endpoint serves as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined for the AWS service. You can specify an endpoint policy to attach to the endpoint, which will control access to the service from your VPC. You can also specify the VPC route tables that use the endpoint. An interface endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves as an endpoint for communicating with the specified service. You can specify the subnets in which to create an endpoint, and the security groups to associate with the endpoint network interface. Use DescribeVpcEndpointServices to get a list of supported services.

# Required Parameters
- `ServiceName`: The service name. To get a list of available services, use the DescribeVpcEndpointServices request, or get the name from the service provider.
- `VpcId`: The ID of the VPC in which the endpoint will be used.

# Optional Parameters
- `ClientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to Ensure Idempotency.
- `DryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `PolicyDocument`: A policy to attach to the endpoint that controls access to the service. The policy must be in valid JSON format. If this parameter is not specified, we attach a default policy that allows full access to the service.
- `PrivateDnsEnabled`: (Interface endpoint) Indicates whether to associate a private hosted zone with the specified VPC. The private hosted zone contains a record set for the default public DNS name for the service for the Region (for example, kinesis.us-east-1.amazonaws.com), which resolves to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces in the VPC. This enables you to make requests to the default public DNS name for the service instead of the public DNS names that are automatically generated by the VPC endpoint service. To use a private hosted zone, you must set the following VPC attributes to true: enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport. Use ModifyVpcAttribute to set the VPC attributes. Default: true 
- `RouteTableId`: (Gateway endpoint) One or more route table IDs.

Failed requests are retained for 60 minutes.      end-date - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time.    end-date-type - Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:    unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it.    limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time.      instance-match-criteria - Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:    open - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.    targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.    
- `MaxResults`: The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If maxResults is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error.

    DescribeInstances()

Describes the specified instances or all instances. If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully. If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output. Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

    DescribeReservedInstancesListings()

Describes your account's Reserved Instance listings in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Reserved Instances. As a seller, you choose to list some or all of your Reserved Instances, and you specify the upfront price to receive for them. Your Reserved Instances are then listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace and are available for purchase. As a buyer, you specify the configuration of the Reserved Instance to purchase, and the Marketplace matches what you're searching for with what's available. The Marketplace first sells the lowest priced Reserved Instances to you, and continues to sell available Reserved Instance listings to you until your demand is met. You are charged based on the total price of all of the listings that you purchase. For more information, see Reserved Instance Marketplace in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

    DescribeSnapshots()

Describes the specified EBS snapshots available to you or all of the EBS snapshots available to you. The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by other AWS accounts for which you have explicit create volume permissions. The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:    public: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the all group. All AWS accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.    explicit: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific AWS account.    implicit: An AWS account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.   The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or AWS accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions. If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results. If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the OwnerIds option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the AWS account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for snapshots owned by Amazon, or self for snapshots that you own. If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify AWS account IDs (if you own the snapshots), self for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or all for public snapshots. If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The MaxResults parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to a subsequent DescribeSnapshots request to retrieve the remaining results. To get the state of fast snapshot restores for a snapshot, use DescribeFastSnapshotRestores. For more information about EBS snapshots, see Amazon EBS Snapshots in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
- `Filter`: The filters.    description - A description of the snapshot.    encrypted - Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted (true | false)    owner-alias - The owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list (amazon). This is not the user-configured AWS account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.    owner-id - The AWS account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.    progress - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).    snapshot-id - The snapshot ID.    start-time - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.    status - The status of the snapshot (pending | completed | error).    tag:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.    volume-id - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.    volume-size - The size of the volume, in GiB.  
- `MaxResults`: The maximum number of snapshot results returned by DescribeSnapshots in paginated output. When this parameter is used, DescribeSnapshots only returns MaxResults results in a single page along with a NextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another DescribeSnapshots request with the returned NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 1000; if MaxResults is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then DescribeSnapshots returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the snapshot IDs parameter in the same request.
- `NextToken`: The NextToken value returned from a previous paginated DescribeSnapshots request where MaxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the NextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
- `Owner`: Scopes the results to snapshots with the specified owners. You can specify a combination of AWS account IDs, self, and amazon.
- `RestorableBy`: The IDs of the AWS accounts that can create volumes from the snapshot.

    DescribeSpotInstanceRequests()

Describes the specified Spot Instance requests. You can use DescribeSpotInstanceRequests to find a running Spot Instance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is fulfilled, the instance ID appears in the response and contains the identifier of the instance. Alternatively, you can use DescribeInstances with a filter to look for instances where the instance lifecycle is spot. We recommend that you set MaxResults to a value between 5 and 1000 to limit the number of results returned. This paginates the output, which makes the list more manageable and returns the results faster. If the list of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to a subsequent DescribeSpotInstanceRequests request to retrieve the remaining results. Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they are canceled and their instances are terminated.

"""
    DescribeVolumeStatus()

Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event. The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:  Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks may still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see Monitoring the status of your volumes in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and may require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and may have inconsistent data.  Actions: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency. Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

# Optional Parameters
- `Filter`: The filters.    action.code - The action code for the event (for example, enable-volume-io).    action.description - A description of the action.    action.event-id - The event ID associated with the action.    availability-zone - The Availability Zone of the instance.    event.description - A description of the event.    event.event-id - The event ID.    event.event-type - The event type (for io-enabled: passed | failed; for io-performance: io-performance:degraded | io-performance:severely-degraded | io-performance:stalled).    event.not-after - The latest end time for the event.    event.not-before - The earliest start time for the event.    volume-status.details-name - The cause for volume-status.status (io-enabled | io-performance).    volume-status.details-status - The status of volume-status.details-name (for io-enabled: passed | failed; for io-performance: normal | degraded | severely-degraded | stalled).    volume-status.status - The status of the volume (ok | impaired | warning | insufficient-data).  
- `MaxResults`: The maximum number of volume results returned by DescribeVolumeStatus in paginated output. When this parameter is used, the request only returns MaxResults results in a single page along with a NextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 1000; if MaxResults is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then DescribeVolumeStatus returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the volume IDs parameter in the same request.
- `NextToken`: The NextToken value to include in a future DescribeVolumeStatus request. When the results of the request exceed MaxResults, this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
- `VolumeId`: The IDs of the volumes. Default: Describes all your volumes.
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.

    DetachVolume()

Detaches an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the busy state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be delayed indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the instance, or all three. If an EBS volume is the root device of an instance, it can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach the root volume, stop the instance first. When a volume with an AWS Marketplace product code is detached from an instance, the product code is no longer associated with the instance. For more information, see Detaching an Amazon EBS volume in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `VolumeId`: The ID of the volume.

# Optional Parameters
- `Device`: The device name.
- `Force`: Forces detachment if the previous detachment attempt did not occur cleanly (for example, logging into an instance, unmounting the volume, and detaching normally). This option can lead to data loss or a corrupted file system. Use this option only as a last resort to detach a volume from a failed instance. The instance won't have an opportunity to flush file system caches or file system metadata. If you use this option, you must perform file system check and repair procedures.
- `InstanceId`: The ID of the instance. If you are detaching a Multi-Attach enabled volume, you must specify an instance ID.

    ModifyEbsDefaultKmsKeyId()

Changes the default customer master key (CMK) for EBS encryption by default for your account in this Region. AWS creates a unique AWS managed CMK in each Region for use with encryption by default. If you change the default CMK to a symmetric customer managed CMK, it is used instead of the AWS managed CMK. To reset the default CMK to the AWS managed CMK for EBS, use ResetEbsDefaultKmsKeyId. Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs. If you delete or disable the customer managed CMK that you specified for use with encryption by default, your instances will fail to launch.

    ModifyFleet()

Modifies the specified EC2 Fleet. You can only modify an EC2 Fleet request of type maintain. While the EC2 Fleet is being modified, it is in the modifying state. To scale up your EC2 Fleet, increase its target capacity. The EC2 Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the EC2 Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is lowest-price, the EC2 Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is diversified, the EC2 Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized, EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching. To scale down your EC2 Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the EC2 Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the EC2 Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is lowest-price, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is diversified, the EC2 Fleet terminates instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the EC2 Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually. If you are finished with your EC2 Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the target capacity to 0.

# Required Parameters

    ModifyInstanceAttribute()

Modifies the specified attribute of the specified instance. You can specify only one attribute at a time.  Note: Using this action to change the security groups associated with an elastic network interface (ENI) attached to an instance in a VPC can result in an error if the instance has more than one ENI. To change the security groups associated with an ENI attached to an instance that has multiple ENIs, we recommend that you use the ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute action. To modify some attributes, the instance must be stopped. For more information, see Modifying attributes of a stopped instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `instanceId`: The ID of the instance.

# Optional Parameters
- `GroupId`: [EC2-VPC] Changes the security groups of the instance. You must specify at least one security group, even if it's just the default security group for the VPC. You must specify the security group ID, not the security group name.
- `SourceDestCheck`: Specifies whether source/destination checking is enabled. A value of true means that checking is enabled, and false means that checking is disabled. This value must be false for a NAT instance to perform NAT.
- `attribute`: The name of the attribute.
- `blockDeviceMapping`: Modifies the DeleteOnTermination attribute for volumes that are currently attached. The volume must be owned by the caller. If no value is specified for DeleteOnTermination, the default is true and the volume is deleted when the instance is terminated. To add instance store volumes to an Amazon EBS-backed instance, you must add them when you launch the instance. For more information, see Updating the block device mapping when launching an instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
- `disableApiTermination`: If the value is true, you can't terminate the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API; otherwise, you can. You cannot use this parameter for Spot Instances.
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.

Modifies the specified Spot Fleet request. You can only modify a Spot Fleet request of type maintain. While the Spot Fleet request is being modified, it is in the modifying state. To scale up your Spot Fleet, increase its target capacity. The Spot Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the Spot Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is lowestPrice, the Spot Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is diversified, the Spot Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is capacityOptimized, Spot Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching. To scale down your Spot Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the Spot Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is lowestPrice, the Spot Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is capacityOptimized, the Spot Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is diversified, the Spot Fleet terminates instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually. If you are finished with your Spot Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the target capacity to 0.

# Required Parameters
- `spotFleetRequestId`: The ID of the Spot Fleet request.

# Optional Parameters
- `LaunchTemplateConfig`: The launch template and overrides. You can only use this parameter if you specified a launch template (LaunchTemplateConfigs) in your Spot Fleet request. If you specified LaunchSpecifications in your Spot Fleet request, then omit this parameter.
- `OnDemandTargetCapacity`: The number of On-Demand Instances in the fleet.
- `excessCapacityTerminationPolicy`: Indicates whether running Spot Instances should be terminated if the target capacity of the Spot Fleet request is decreased below the current size of the Spot Fleet.
- `targetCapacity`: The size of the fleet.

    ModifyVolume()

You can modify several parameters of an existing EBS volume, including volume size, volume type, and IOPS capacity. If your EBS volume is attached to a current-generation EC2 instance type, you may be able to apply these changes without stopping the instance or detaching the volume from it. For more information about modifying an EBS volume running Linux, see Modifying the size, IOPS, or type of an EBS volume on Linux. For more information about modifying an EBS volume running Windows, see Modifying the size, IOPS, or type of an EBS volume on Windows.   When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the volume's file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For information about extending a Linux file system, see Extending a Linux file system. For information about extending a Windows file system, see Extending a Windows file system.   You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. You can also track the status of a modification using DescribeVolumesModifications. For information about tracking status changes using either method, see Monitoring volume modifications.  With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume may require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance. For more information, see Modifying the size, IOPS, or type of an EBS volume on Linux and Modifying the size, IOPS, or type of an EBS volume on Windows. If you reach the maximum volume modification rate per volume limit, you will need to wait at least six hours before applying further modifications to the affected EBS volume.

    RegisterImage()

Registers an AMI. When you're creating an AMI, this is the final step you must complete before you can launch an instance from the AMI. For more information about creating AMIs, see Creating your own AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  For Amazon EBS-backed instances, CreateImage creates and registers the AMI in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI yourself.  You can also use RegisterImage to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using the block device mapping. For more information, see Launching a Linux instance from a backup in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. If any snapshots have AWS Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI. Windows and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use the EC2 billing product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription status for package updates. To create a new AMI for operating systems that require a billing product code, instead of registering the AMI, do the following to preserve the billing product code association:   Launch an instance from an existing AMI with that billing product code.   Customize the instance.   Create an AMI from the instance using CreateImage.   If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code, the Reserved Instance will not be applied to the On-Demand Instance. For information about how to obtain the platform details and billing information of an AMI, see Obtaining billing information in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.

# Required Parameters
- `name`: A name for your AMI. Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.), slashes (/), dashes (-), single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)

# Optional Parameters
- `BillingProduct`: The billing product codes. Your account must be authorized to specify billing product codes. Otherwise, you can use the AWS Marketplace to bill for the use of an AMI.
- `BlockDeviceMapping`: The block device mapping entries.
- `ImageLocation`: The full path to your AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage. The specified bucket must have the aws-exec-read canned access control list (ACL) to ensure that it can be accessed by Amazon EC2. For more information, see Canned ACLs in the Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide.
- `architecture`: The architecture of the AMI. Default: For Amazon EBS-backed AMIs, i386. For instance store-backed AMIs, the architecture specified in the manifest file.
- `description`: A description for your AMI.
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `enaSupport`: Set to true to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the AMI and any instances that you launch from the AMI. This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.
- `kernelId`: The ID of the kernel.
- `ramdiskId`: The ID of the RAM disk.
- `rootDeviceName`: The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1).

    RequestSpotFleet()

Creates a Spot Fleet request. The Spot Fleet request specifies the total target capacity and the On-Demand target capacity. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference between the total capacity and On-Demand capacity, and launches the difference as Spot capacity. You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch specifications that vary by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet. By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot Instance pool where the price per unit is the lowest. Each launch specification can include its own instance weighting that reflects the value of the instance type to your application workload. Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the target capacity across the Spot pools included in its launch specifications. By ensuring that the Spot Instances in your Spot Fleet are in different Spot pools, you can improve the availability of your fleet. You can specify tags for the Spot Fleet request and instances launched by the fleet. You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot Fleet request because only the spot-fleet-request and instance resource types are supported. For more information, see Spot Fleet requests in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

# Required Parameters
- `spotFleetRequestConfig`: The configuration for the Spot Fleet request.

# Optional Parameters
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.

"""
    RequestSpotInstances()

Creates a Spot Instance request. For more information, see Spot Instance requests in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

# Optional Parameters
- `InstanceInterruptionBehavior`: The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is terminate.
- `LaunchSpecification`: The launch specification.
- `TagSpecification`: The key-value pair for tagging the Spot Instance request on creation. The value for ResourceType must be spot-instances-request, otherwise the Spot Instance request fails. To tag the Spot Instance request after it has been created, see CreateTags. 
- `availabilityZoneGroup`: The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests. When you specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance request, all Spot Instances in the request are launched in the same Availability Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this parameter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional Spot Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone group name are launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group is still active. If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group that you specify for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you specified the same Availability Zone group. Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.
- `blockDurationMinutes`: The required duration for the Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks), in minutes. This value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360). The duration period starts as soon as your Spot Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration period, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates. You can't specify an Availability Zone group or a launch group if you specify a duration.
- `clientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to Ensure Idempotency in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `instanceCount`: The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch. Default: 1
- `launchGroup`: The instance launch group. Launch groups are Spot Instances that launch together and terminate together. Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually
- `spotPrice`: The maximum price per hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. The default is the On-Demand price.
- `type`: The Spot Instance request type. Default: one-time 
- `validFrom`: The start date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until all instances launch, the request expires, or the request is canceled. If the request is persistent, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is canceled. The specified start date and time cannot be equal to the current date and time. You must specify a start date and time that occurs after the current date and time.
- `validUntil`: The end date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request remains active until all instances launch, the request is canceled, or this date is reached. If the request is persistent, it remains active until it is canceled or this date is reached. The default end date is 7 days from the current date.

    RevokeSecurityGroupIngress()

Removes the specified ingress rules from a security group. To remove a rule, the values that you specify (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values exactly.  [EC2-Classic only] If the values you specify do not match the existing rule's values, no error is returned. Use DescribeSecurityGroups to verify that the rule has been removed.  Each rule consists of the protocol and the CIDR range or source security group. For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security group rule has a description, you do not have to specify the description to revoke the rule. Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

# Optional Parameters
- `CidrIp`: The CIDR IP address range. You can't specify this parameter when specifying a source security group.
- `FromPort`: The start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number. For the ICMP type number, use -1 to specify all ICMP types.
- `GroupId`: The ID of the security group. You must specify either the security group ID or the security group name in the request. For security groups in a nondefault VPC, you must specify the security group ID.
- `GroupName`: [EC2-Classic, default VPC] The name of the security group. You must specify either the security group ID or the security group name in the request.
- `IpPermissions`: The sets of IP permissions. You can't specify a source security group and a CIDR IP address range in the same set of permissions.
- `IpProtocol`: The IP protocol name (tcp, udp, icmp) or number (see Protocol Numbers). Use -1 to specify all.
- `SourceSecurityGroupName`: [EC2-Classic, default VPC] The name of the source security group. You can't specify this parameter in combination with the following parameters: the CIDR IP address range, the start of the port range, the IP protocol, and the end of the port range. For EC2-VPC, the source security group must be in the same VPC. To revoke a specific rule for an IP protocol and port range, use a set of IP permissions instead.
- `SourceSecurityGroupOwnerId`: [EC2-Classic] The AWS account ID of the source security group, if the source security group is in a different account. You can't specify this parameter in combination with the following parameters: the CIDR IP address range, the IP protocol, the start of the port range, and the end of the port range. To revoke a specific rule for an IP protocol and port range, use a set of IP permissions instead.
- `ToPort`: The end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code number. For the ICMP code number, use -1 to specify all ICMP codes for the ICMP type.
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.

    RunInstances()

Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions. You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply:   [EC2-VPC] If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request.   [EC2-Classic] If don't specify an Availability Zone, we choose one for you.   Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails. For more information, see Instance types available only in a VPC.   [EC2-VPC] All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet.   Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more information, see Instance types.   If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security group. For more information, see Security groups.   If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails.   You can create a launch template, which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using RunInstances, you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters. To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances. An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the running state. You can check the state of your instance using DescribeInstances. You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see CreateTags and Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources. Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see Key pairs in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. For troubleshooting, see What to do if an instance immediately terminates, and Troubleshooting connecting to your instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `MaxCount`: The maximum number of instances to launch. If you specify more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches the largest possible number of instances above MinCount. Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you're allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2 in the Amazon EC2 FAQ.
- `MinCount`: The minimum number of instances to launch. If you specify a minimum that is more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches no instances. Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you're allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2 in the Amazon EC2 General FAQ.

# Optional Parameters
- `BlockDeviceMapping`: The block device mapping entries.
- `CapacityReservationSpecification`: Information about the Capacity Reservation targeting option. If you do not specify this parameter, the instance's Capacity Reservation preference defaults to open, which enables it to run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone).
- `CpuOptions`: The CPU options for the instance. For more information, see Optimizing CPU options in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
- `CreditSpecification`: The credit option for CPU usage of the burstable performance instance. Valid values are standard and unlimited. To change this attribute after launch, use  ModifyInstanceCreditSpecification. For more information, see Burstable performance instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. Default: standard (T2 instances) or unlimited (T3/T3a instances)
- `ElasticGpuSpecification`: An elastic GPU to associate with the instance. An Elastic GPU is a GPU resource that you can attach to your Windows instance to accelerate the graphics performance of your applications. For more information, see  Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
- `ElasticInferenceAccelerator`: An elastic inference accelerator to associate with the instance. Elastic inference accelerators are a resource you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instances to accelerate your Deep Learning (DL) inference workloads. You cannot specify accelerators from different generations in the same request.
- `HibernationOptions`: Indicates whether an instance is enabled for hibernation. For more information, see Hibernate your instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
- `ImageId`: The ID of the AMI. An AMI ID is required to launch an instance and must be specified here or in a launch template.
- `InstanceMarketOptions`: The market (purchasing) option for the instances. For RunInstances, persistent Spot Instance requests are only supported when InstanceInterruptionBehavior is set to either hibernate or stop.
- `InstanceType`: The instance type. For more information, see Instance types in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. Default: m1.small 
- `Ipv6Address`: [EC2-VPC] The IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet to associate with the primary network interface. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in the same request. You cannot specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch. You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.
- `Ipv6AddressCount`: [EC2-VPC] The number of IPv6 addresses to associate with the primary network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the range of your subnet. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch. You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.
- `KernelId`: The ID of the kernel.  We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see  PV-GRUB in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. 
- `KeyName`: The name of the key pair. You can create a key pair using CreateKeyPair or ImportKeyPair.  If you do not specify a key pair, you can't connect to the instance unless you choose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in. 
- `LaunchTemplate`: The launch template to use to launch the instances. Any parameters that you specify in RunInstances override the same parameters in the launch template. You can specify either the name or ID of a launch template, but not both.
- `LicenseSpecification`: The license configurations.
- `MetadataOptions`: The metadata options for the instance. For more information, see Instance metadata and user data.
- `Monitoring`: Specifies whether detailed monitoring is enabled for the instance.
- `Placement`: The placement for the instance.
- `RamdiskId`: The ID of the RAM disk to select. Some kernels require additional drivers at launch. Check the kernel requirements for information about whether you need to specify a RAM disk. To find kernel requirements, go to the AWS Resource Center and search for the kernel ID.  We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see  PV-GRUB in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. 
- `SecurityGroup`: [EC2-Classic, default VPC] The names of the security groups. For a nondefault VPC, you must use security group IDs instead. If you specify a network interface, you must specify any security groups as part of the network interface. Default: Amazon EC2 uses the default security group.
- `SecurityGroupId`: The IDs of the security groups. You can create a security group using CreateSecurityGroup. If you specify a network interface, you must specify any security groups as part of the network interface.
- `SubnetId`: [EC2-VPC] The ID of the subnet to launch the instance into. If you specify a network interface, you must specify any subnets as part of the network interface.
- `TagSpecification`: The tags to apply to the resources during launch. You can only tag instances and volumes on launch. The specified tags are applied to all instances or volumes that are created during launch. To tag a resource after it has been created, see CreateTags.
- `UserData`: The user data to make available to the instance. For more information, see Running commands on your Linux instance at launch (Linux) and Adding User Data (Windows). If you are using a command line tool, base64-encoding is performed for you, and you can load the text from a file. Otherwise, you must provide base64-encoded text. User data is limited to 16 KB.
- `additionalInfo`: Reserved.
- `clientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If you do not specify a client token, a randomly generated token is used for the request to ensure idempotency. For more information, see Ensuring Idempotency. Constraints: Maximum 64 ASCII characters
- `disableApiTermination`: If you set this parameter to true, you can't terminate the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API; otherwise, you can. To change this attribute after launch, use ModifyInstanceAttribute. Alternatively, if you set InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior to terminate, you can terminate the instance by running the shutdown command from the instance. Default: false 
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
- `ebsOptimized`: Indicates whether the instance is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal Amazon EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS-optimized instance. Default: false 
- `iamInstanceProfile`: The IAM instance profile.
- `instanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior`: Indicates whether an instance stops or terminates when you initiate shutdown from the instance (using the operating system command for system shutdown). Default: stop 
- `networkInterface`: The network interfaces to associate with the instance. If you specify a network interface, you must specify any security groups and subnets as part of the network interface.
- `privateIpAddress`: [EC2-VPC] The primary IPv4 address. You must specify a value from the IPv4 address range of the subnet. Only one private IP address can be designated as primary. You can't specify this option if you've specified the option to designate a private IP address as the primary IP address in a network interface specification. You cannot specify this option if you're launching more than one instance in the request. You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.

    StartInstances()

Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped. Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage. Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.

    StopInstances()

Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is enabled for hibernation and it meets the hibernation prerequisites. For more information, see Hibernate your instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage.

If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage. You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. You can't use the Stop action to hibernate Spot Instances, but you can specify that Amazon EC2 should hibernate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. For more information, see Hibernating interrupted Spot Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs. Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see Instance lifecycle in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see Troubleshooting stopping your instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `InstanceId`: The IDs of the instances.

    TerminateInstances()

Shuts down the specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.  If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated. Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour). By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running. You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the DeleteOnTermination block device mapping parameter set to true are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see Instance lifecycle in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. For more information about troubleshooting, see Troubleshooting terminating your instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `InstanceId`: The IDs of the instances. Constraints: Up to 1000 instance IDs. We recommend breaking up this request into smaller batches.

# Optional Parameters
- `dryRun`: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
