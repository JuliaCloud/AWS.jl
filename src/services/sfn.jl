    ListTagsForResource()

List tags for a given resource. Tags may only contain Unicode letters, digits, white space, or these symbols: _ . : / = + - @.

"""
    GetActivityTask()

Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN) which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns a taskToken with a null string.  Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65 seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the poll request). Polling with GetActivityTask can cause latency in some implementations. See Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks in the Step Functions Developer Guide. 

Required Parameters
{
  "activityArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the activity to retrieve tasks from (assigned when you create the task using CreateActivity.)"
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "workerName": "You can provide an arbitrary name in order to identify the worker that the task is assigned to. This name is used when it is logged in the execution history."

    SendTaskHeartbeat()

Used by activity workers and task states using the callback pattern to report to Step Functions that the task represented by the specified taskToken is still making progress. This action resets the Heartbeat clock. The Heartbeat threshold is specified in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition (HeartbeatSeconds). This action does not in itself create an event in the execution history. However, if the task times out, the execution history contains an ActivityTimedOut entry for activities, or a TaskTimedOut entry for for tasks using the job run or callback pattern.  The Timeout of a task, defined in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition, is its maximum allowed duration, regardless of the number of SendTaskHeartbeat requests received. Use HeartbeatSeconds to configure the timeout interval for heartbeats. 

Required Parameters
{
  "taskToken": "The token that represents this task. Task tokens are generated by Step Functions when tasks are assigned to a worker, or in the context object when a workflow enters a task state. See GetActivityTaskOutput taskToken."

"""
    GetExecutionHistory()

Returns the history of the specified execution as a list of events. By default, the results are returned in ascending order of the timeStamp of the events. Use the reverseOrder parameter to get the latest events first. If nextToken is returned, there are more results available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an HTTP 400 InvalidToken error. This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

    CreateActivity()

Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the GetActivityTask API action and respond using SendTask* API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.    CreateActivity is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateActivity's idempotency check is based on the activity name. If a following request has different tags values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, tags will not be updated, even if they are different. 

Required Parameters
{
  "name": "The name of the activity to create. This name must be unique for your AWS account and region for 90 days.
