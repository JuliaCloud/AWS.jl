    CreateActivity()

Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the GetActivityTask API action and respond using SendTask* API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.    CreateActivity is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateActivity's idempotency check is based on the activity name. If a following request has different tags values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, tags will not be updated, even if they are different. 

Required Parameters
name => The name of the activity to create. This name must be unique for your AWS account and region for 90 days. For more information, see  Limits Related to State Machine Executions in the AWS Step Functions Developer Guide. A name must not contain:   white space   brackets &lt; &gt; { } [ ]    wildcard characters ? *    special characters " # %   ^ | ~ `   &amp; , ; : /    control characters (U+0000-001F, U+007F-009F)   To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only contain 0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

Optional Parameters
tags => The list of tags to add to a resource. An array of key-value pairs. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide, and Controlling Access Using IAM Tags. Tags may only contain Unicode letters, digits, white space, or these symbols: _ . : / = + - @.

"""
    CreateStateMachine()

Creates a state machine. A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (Task states), determine to which states to transition next (Choice states), stop an execution with an error (Fail states), and so on. State machines are specified using a JSON-based, structured language. For more information, see Amazon States Language in the AWS Step Functions User Guide.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.    CreateStateMachine is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateStateMachine's idempotency check is based on the state machine name, definition, type, and LoggingConfiguration. If a following request has a different roleArn or tags, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, roleArn and tags will not be updated, even if they are different. 

Required Parameters
definition => The Amazon States Language definition of the state machine. See Amazon States Language.
name => The name of the state machine.  A name must not contain:   white space   brackets &lt; &gt; { } [ ]    wildcard characters ? *    special characters " # %   ^ | ~ `   &amp; , ; : /    control characters (U+0000-001F, U+007F-009F)   To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only contain 0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.
roleArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to use for this state machine.

Optional Parameters
loggingConfiguration => Defines what execution history events are logged and where they are logged.  By default, the level is set to OFF. For more information see Log Levels in the AWS Step Functions User Guide. 
tags => Tags to be added when creating a state machine. An array of key-value pairs. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide, and Controlling Access Using IAM Tags. Tags may only contain Unicode letters, digits, white space, or these symbols: _ . : / = + - @.
type => Determines whether a Standard or Express state machine is created. The default is STANDARD. You cannot update the type of a state machine once it has been created.

"""
    GetActivityTask()

Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN) which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns a taskToken with a null string.  Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65 seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the poll request). Polling with GetActivityTask can cause latency in some implementations. See Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks in the Step Functions Developer Guide. 

Required Parameters
activityArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the activity to retrieve tasks from (assigned when you create the task using CreateActivity.)

Optional Parameters
workerName => You can provide an arbitrary name in order to identify the worker that the task is assigned to. This name is used when it is logged in the execution history.

    GetExecutionHistory()

Returns the history of the specified execution as a list of events. By default, the results are returned in ascending order of the timeStamp of the events.

Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours.
