    GetCostAndUsage()

Retrieves cost and usage metrics for your account. You can specify which cost and usage-related metric, such as BlendedCosts or UsageQuantity, that you want the request to return. You can also filter and group your data by various dimensions, such as SERVICE or AZ, in a specific time range. For a complete list of valid dimensions, see the GetDimensionValues operation. Management account in an organization in AWS Organizations have access to all member accounts. For information about filter limitations, see Quotas and restrictions in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `Metrics`: Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information about blended and unblended rates, see Why does the \"blended\" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?.  Valid values are AmortizedCost, BlendedCost, NetAmortizedCost, NetUnblendedCost, NormalizedUsageAmount, UnblendedCost, and UsageQuantity.   If you return the UsageQuantity metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate usageQuantity across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours vs. GB). To get more meaningful UsageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType or UsageTypeGroups.    Metrics is required for GetCostAndUsage requests.
- `TimePeriod`: Sets the start and end dates for retrieving AWS costs. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including 2017-04-30 but not including 2017-05-01.

# Optional Parameters
- `Filter`: Filters AWS costs by different dimensions. For example, you can specify SERVICE and LINKED_ACCOUNT and get the costs that are associated with that account's usage of that service. You can nest Expression objects to define any combination of dimension filters. For more information, see Expression. 
- `Granularity`: Sets the AWS cost granularity to MONTHLY or DAILY, or HOURLY. If Granularity isn't set, the response object doesn't include the Granularity, either MONTHLY or DAILY, or HOURLY. 
- `GroupBy`: You can group AWS costs using up to two different groups, either dimensions, tag keys, cost categories, or any two group by types. When you group by tag key, you get all tag values, including empty strings. Valid values are AZ, INSTANCE_TYPE, LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME, LINKED_ACCOUNT, OPERATION, PLATFORM, PURCHASE_TYPE, SERVICE, TAGS, TENANCY, RECORD_TYPE, and USAGE_TYPE.

For example, you can specify SERVICE and LINKED_ACCOUNT and get the costs that are associated with that account's usage of that service. You can nest Expression objects to define any combination of dimension filters. For more information, see Expression.  The GetCostAndUsageWithResources operation requires that you either group by or filter by a ResourceId. It requires the Expression \"SERVICE = Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute\" in the filter.
- `TimePeriod`: Sets the start and end dates for retrieving Amazon Web Services costs. The range must be within the last 14 days (the start date cannot be earlier than 14 days ago).

    GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation()

Gets recommendations for which reservations to purchase. These recommendations could help you reduce your costs. Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing. AWS generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible for a reservation. After AWS has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings.  For example, AWS automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation would be for c4.large because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.

# Required Parameters
- `Service`: The specific service that you want recommendations for.

# Optional Parameters
- `AccountId`: The account ID that is associated with the recommendation. 
- `AccountScope`: The account scope that you want your recommendations for. Amazon Web Services calculates recommendations including the management account and member accounts if the value is set to PAYER. If the value is LINKED, recommendations are calculated for individual member accounts only.
- `LookbackPeriodInDays`: The number of previous days that you want AWS to consider when it calculates your recommendations.
- `NextPageToken`: The pagination token that indicates the next set of results that you want to retrieve.

    GetSavingsPlansCoverage()

Retrieves the Savings Plans covered for your account. This enables you to see how much of your cost is covered by a Savings Plan. An organization’s management account can see the coverage of the associated member accounts. This supports dimensions, Cost Categories, and nested expressions. For any time period, you can filter data for Savings Plans usage with the following dimensions:    LINKED_ACCOUNT     REGION     SERVICE     INSTANCE_FAMILY    To determine valid values for a dimension, use the GetDimensionValues operation.

# Required Parameters
- `TimePeriod`: The time period that you want the usage and costs for. The Start date must be within 13 months. The End date must be after the Start date, and before the current date. Future dates can't be used as an End date.

# Optional Parameters
- `Filter`: Filters Savings Plans coverage data by dimensions. You can filter data for Savings Plans usage with the following dimensions:    LINKED_ACCOUNT     REGION     SERVICE     INSTANCE_FAMILY     GetSavingsPlansCoverage uses the same Expression object as the other operations, but only AND is supported among each dimension. If there are multiple values for a dimension, they are OR'd together. Cost category is also supported.
- `Granularity`: The granularity of the Amazon Web Services cost data for your Savings Plans. Granularity can't be set if GroupBy is set. The GetSavingsPlansCoverage operation supports only DAILY and MONTHLY granularities.
- `GroupBy`: You can group the data using the attributes INSTANCE_FAMILY, REGION, or SERVICE.
- `MaxResults`: The number of items to be returned in a response. The default is 20, with a minimum value of 1.
- `Metrics`: The measurement that you want your Savings Plans coverage reported in. The only valid value is SpendCoveredBySavingsPlans.
- `NextToken`: The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.
