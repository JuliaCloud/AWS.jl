    GetCostAndUsage()

Retrieves cost and usage metrics for your account. You can specify which cost and usage-related metric, such as BlendedCosts or UsageQuantity, that you want the request to return. You can also filter and group your data by various dimensions, such as SERVICE or AZ, in a specific time range. For a complete list of valid dimensions, see the GetDimensionValues operation. Master accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations have access to all member accounts.

# Required Parameters
- `TimePeriod`: Sets the start and end dates for retrieving AWS costs. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including 2017-04-30 but not including 2017-05-01.

# Optional Parameters
- `Filter`: Filters AWS costs by different dimensions. For example, you can specify SERVICE and LINKED_ACCOUNT and get the costs that are associated with that account's usage of that service. You can nest Expression objects to define any combination of dimension filters. For more information, see Expression. 
- `Granularity`: Sets the AWS cost granularity to MONTHLY or DAILY, or HOURLY. If Granularity isn't set, the response object doesn't include the Granularity, either MONTHLY or DAILY, or HOURLY. 
- `GroupBy`: You can group AWS costs using up to two different groups, either dimensions, tag keys, or both. When you group by tag key, you get all tag values, including empty strings. Valid values are AZ, INSTANCE_TYPE, LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME, LINKED_ACCOUNT, OPERATION, PLATFORM, PURCHASE_TYPE, SERVICE, TAGS, TENANCY, RECORD_TYPE, and USAGE_TYPE.
- `Metrics`: Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information about blended and unblended rates, see Why does the \"blended\" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?.  Valid values are AmortizedCost, BlendedCost, NetAmortizedCost, NetUnblendedCost, NormalizedUsageAmount, UnblendedCost, and UsageQuantity.   If you return the UsageQuantity metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate usageQuantity across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours vs. GB). To get more meaningful UsageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType or UsageTypeGroups.    Metrics is required for GetCostAndUsage requests.
- `NextPageToken`: The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.

    GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation()

Gets recommendations for which reservations to purchase. These recommendations could help you reduce your costs. Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing. AWS generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible for a reservation. After AWS has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings.  For example, AWS automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation would be for c4.large because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.

# Required Parameters
- `Service`: The specific service that you want recommendations for.

# Optional Parameters
- `AccountId`: The account ID that is associated with the recommendation. 
- `AccountScope`: The account scope that you want your recommendations for. Amazon Web Services calculates recommendations including the payer account and linked accounts if the value is set to PAYER. If the value is LINKED, recommendations are calculated for individual linked accounts only.

"""
    GetSavingsPlansUtilizationDetails()

Retrieves attribute data along with aggregate utilization and savings data for a given time period. This doesn't support granular or grouped data (daily/monthly) in response. You can't retrieve data by dates in a single response similar to GetSavingsPlanUtilization, but you have the option to make multiple calls to GetSavingsPlanUtilizationDetails by providing individual dates. You can use GetDimensionValues in SAVINGS_PLANS to determine the possible dimension values.   GetSavingsPlanUtilizationDetails internally groups data by SavingsPlansArn. 

# Required Parameters
- `TimePeriod`: The time period that you want the usage and costs for. The Start date must be within 13 months. The End date must be after the Start date, and before the current date. Future dates can't be used as an End date.

# Optional Parameters
- `Filter`: Filters Savings Plans utilization coverage data for active Savings Plans dimensions. You can filter data with the following dimensions:    LINKED_ACCOUNT     SAVINGS_PLAN_ARN     REGION     PAYMENT_OPTION     INSTANCE_TYPE_FAMILY     GetSavingsPlansUtilizationDetails uses the same Expression object as the other operations, but only AND is supported among each dimension.
- `MaxResults`: The number of items to be returned in a response. The default is 20, with a minimum value of 1.
- `NextToken`: The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.

    GetTags()

Queries for available tag keys and tag values for a specified period. You can search the tag values for an arbitrary string. 

# Required Parameters
- `TimePeriod`: The start and end dates for retrieving the dimension values. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including 2017-04-30 but not including 2017-05-01.

# Optional Parameters
- `NextPageToken`: The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.
- `SearchString`: The value that you want to search for.
- `TagKey`: The key of the tag that you want to return values for.

    GetUsageForecast()

Retrieves a forecast for how much Amazon Web Services predicts that you will use over the forecast time period that you select, based on your past usage. 

# Required Parameters
- `Granularity`: How granular you want the forecast to be. You can get 3 months of DAILY forecasts or 12 months of MONTHLY forecasts. The GetUsageForecast operation supports only DAILY and MONTHLY granularities.
- `Metric`: Which metric Cost Explorer uses to create your forecast. Valid values for a GetUsageForecast call are the following:   USAGE_QUANTITY   NORMALIZED_USAGE_AMOUNT  
- `TimePeriod`: The start and end dates of the period that you want to retrieve usage forecast for. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including 2017-04-30 but not including 2017-05-01.

# Optional Parameters
- `Filter`: The filters that you want to use to filter your forecast. Cost Explorer API supports all of the Cost Explorer filters.
- `PredictionIntervalLevel`: Cost Explorer always returns the mean forecast as a single point. You can request a prediction interval around the mean by specifying a confidence level. The higher the confidence level, the more confident Cost Explorer is about the actual value falling in the prediction interval. Higher confidence levels result in wider prediction intervals.
