    create_channel(channel_group_name, channel_name)
    create_channel(channel_group_name, channel_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Create a channel to start receiving content streams. The channel represents the input to
MediaPackage for incoming live content from an encoder such as AWS Elemental MediaLive. The
channel receives content, and after packaging it, outputs it through an origin endpoint to
downstream devices (such as video players or CDNs) that request the content. You can create
only one channel with each request. We recommend that you spread out channels between
channel groups, such as putting redundant channels in the same AWS Region in different
channel groups.

# Arguments
- `channel_group_name`: The name that describes the channel group. The name is the primary
  identifier for the channel group, and must be unique for your account in the AWS Region.
- `channel_name`: The name that describes the channel. The name is the primary identifier
  for the channel, and must be unique for your account in the AWS Region and channel group.
  You can't change the name after you create the channel.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: Enter any descriptive text that helps you to identify the channel.
- `"InputType"`: The input type will be an immutable field which will be used to define
  whether the channel will allow CMAF ingest or HLS ingest. If unprovided, it will default to
  HLS to preserve current behavior. The allowed values are:    HLS - The HLS streaming
  specification (which defines M3U8 manifests and TS segments).    CMAF - The DASH-IF CMAF
  Ingest specification (which defines CMAF segments with optional DASH manifests).
- `"tags"`: A comma-separated list of tag key:value pairs that you define. For example:
  \"Key1\": \"Value1\",   \"Key2\": \"Value2\"
- `"x-amzn-client-token"`: A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.

"""
    create_channel_group(channel_group_name)
    create_channel_group(channel_group_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Create a channel group to group your channels and origin endpoints. A channel group is the
top-level resource that consists of channels and origin endpoints that are associated with
it and that provides predictable URLs for stream delivery. All channels and origin
endpoints within the channel group are guaranteed to share the DNS. You can create only one
channel group with each request.

# Arguments
- `channel_group_name`: The name that describes the channel group. The name is the primary
  identifier for the channel group, and must be unique for your account in the AWS Region.
  You can't use spaces in the name. You can't change the name after you create the channel
  group.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: Enter any descriptive text that helps you to identify the channel group.
- `"tags"`: A comma-separated list of tag key:value pairs that you define. For example:

    create_origin_endpoint(channel_group_name, channel_name, container_type, origin_endpoint_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The endpoint is attached to a channel, and represents the output of the live content. You
can associate multiple endpoints to a single channel. Each endpoint gives players and
downstream CDNs (such as Amazon CloudFront) access to the content for playback. Content
can't be served from a channel until it has an endpoint. You can create only one endpoint
with each request.

# Arguments
- `channel_group_name`: The name that describes the channel group. The name is the primary
  identifier for the channel group, and must be unique for your account in the AWS Region.
- `channel_name`: The name that describes the channel. The name is the primary identifier
  for the channel, and must be unique for your account in the AWS Region and channel group.
- `container_type`: The type of container to attach to this origin endpoint. A container
  type is a file format that encapsulates one or more media streams, such as audio and video,
  into a single file. You can't change the container type after you create the endpoint.
- `origin_endpoint_name`: The name that describes the origin endpoint. The name is the
  primary identifier for the origin endpoint, and must be unique for your account in the AWS
  Region and channel. You can't use spaces in the name. You can't change the name after you
  create the endpoint.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DashManifests"`: A DASH manifest configuration.
- `"Description"`: Enter any descriptive text that helps you to identify the origin
  endpoint.
- `"ForceEndpointErrorConfiguration"`: The failover settings for the endpoint.
- `"HlsManifests"`: An HTTP live streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.
- `"LowLatencyHlsManifests"`: A low-latency HLS manifest configuration.
- `"Segment"`: The segment configuration, including the segment name, duration, and other
  configuration values.
- `"StartoverWindowSeconds"`: The size of the window (in seconds) to create a window of the
  live stream that's available for on-demand viewing. Viewers can start-over or catch-up on
  content that falls within the window. The maximum startover window is 1,209,600 seconds (14
  days).
- `"Tags"`: A comma-separated list of tag key:value pairs that you define. For example:
  \"Key1\": \"Value1\",   \"Key2\": \"Value2\"
- `"x-amzn-client-token"`: A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.
