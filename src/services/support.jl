    ResolveCase()

Takes a caseId and returns the initial state of the case along with the state of the case after the call to ResolveCase completed.

Optional Parameters
{
  "caseId": "The AWS Support case ID requested or returned in the call. The case ID is an alphanumeric string formatted as shown in this example: case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47 "

    CreateCase()

Creates a new case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is modeled on the behavior of the AWS Support Center Create Case page. Its parameters require you to specify the following information:    issueType. The type of issue for the case. You can specify either "customer-service" or "technical." If you do not indicate a value, the default is "technical."  Service limit increases are not supported by the Support API; you must submit service limit increase requests in Support Center. The caseId is not the displayId that appears in Support Center. You can use the DescribeCases API to get the displayId.     serviceCode. The code for an AWS service. You can get the possible serviceCode values by calling DescribeServices.    categoryCode. The category for the service defined for the serviceCode value. You also get the category code for a service by calling DescribeServices. Each AWS service defines its own set of category codes.    severityCode. A value that indicates the urgency of the case, which in turn determines the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You can get the possible severityCode values by calling DescribeSeverityLevels. For more information about the meaning of the codes, see SeverityLevel and Choosing a Severity.    subject. The Subject field on the AWS Support Center Create Case page.    communicationBody. The Description field on the AWS Support Center Create Case page.    attachmentSetId. The ID of a set of attachments that has been created by using AddAttachmentsToSet.    language. The human language in which AWS Support handles the case. English and Japanese are currently supported.    ccEmailAddresses. The AWS Support Center CC field on the Create Case page. You can list email addresses to be copied on any correspondence about the case. The account that opens the case is already identified by passing the AWS Credentials in the HTTP POST method or in a method or function call from one of the programming languages supported by an AWS SDK.     To add additional communication or attachments to an existing case, use AddCommunicationToCase.  A successful CreateCase request returns an AWS Support case number. Case numbers are used by the DescribeCases operation to retrieve existing AWS Support cases.

Required Parameters
{
  "communicationBody": "The communication body text when you create an AWS Support case by calling CreateCase.",
  "subject": "The title of the AWS Support case."
}

{
  "serviceCode": "The code for the AWS service returned by the call to DescribeServices.",

  "attachmentSetId": "The ID of a set of one or more attachments for the case. Create the set by using AddAttachmentsToSet.",

    AddAttachmentsToSet()

Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set. If an attachmentSetId is not specified, a new attachment set is created, and the ID of the set is returned in the response. If an attachmentSetId is specified, the attachments are added to the specified set, if it exists. An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that are to be added to a case or case communication.

    DescribeCases()

Returns a list of cases that you specify by passing one or more case IDs. In addition, you can filter the cases by date by setting values for the afterTime and beforeTime request parameters.

If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error. The response returns the following in JSON format:   One or more CaseDetails data types.

    DescribeServices()

Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service categories that applies to each one. You then use service names and categories in your CreateCase requests.
