    add_attachments_to_set(attachments)
    add_attachments_to_set(attachments, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set.  An attachment set is a temporary
container for attachments that you add to a case or case communication. The set is
available for 1 hour after it's created. The expiryTime returned in the response is when
the set expires.     You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS
Support API.    If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a
Business or Enterprise support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message
appears. For information about changing your support plan, see AWS Support.

# Arguments
- `attachments`: One or more attachments to add to the set. You can add up to three
  attachments per set. The size limit is 5 MB per attachment. In the Attachment object, use
  the data parameter to specify the contents of the attachment file. In the previous request
  syntax, the value for data appear as blob, which is represented as a base64-encoded string.
  The value for fileName is the name of the attachment, such as troubleshoot-screenshot.png.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"attachmentSetId"`: The ID of the attachment set. If an attachmentSetId is not
  specified, a new attachment set is created, and the ID of the set is returned in the
  response. If an attachmentSetId is specified, the attachments are added to the specified
  set, if it exists.

    add_communication_to_case(communication_body)
    add_communication_to_case(communication_body, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Adds additional customer communication to an AWS Support case. Use the caseId parameter to
identify the case to which to add communication. You can list a set of email addresses to
copy on the communication by using the ccEmailAddresses parameter. The communicationBody
value contains the text of the communication.    You must have a Business or Enterprise
support plan to use the AWS Support API.    If you call the AWS Support API from an account
that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException
error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see AWS Support.

# Arguments
- `communication_body`: The body of an email communication to add to the support case.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"attachmentSetId"`: The ID of a set of one or more attachments for the communication to
  add to the case. Create the set by calling AddAttachmentsToSet
- `"caseId"`: The AWS Support case ID requested or returned in the call. The case ID is an
  alphanumeric string formatted as shown in this example:
  case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47

"""
    create_case(communication_body, subject)
    create_case(communication_body, subject, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is similar to how you create a
case in the AWS Support Center Create Case page. The AWS Support API doesn't support
requesting service limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the
following ways:    Submit a request from the AWS Support Center Create Case page.   Use the
Service Quotas RequestServiceQuotaIncrease operation.   A successful CreateCase request
returns an AWS Support case number. You can use the DescribeCases operation and specify the
case number to get existing AWS Support cases. After you create a case, use the
AddCommunicationToCase operation to add additional communication or attachments to an
existing case. The caseId is separate from the displayId that appears in the AWS Support
Center. Use the DescribeCases operation to get the displayId.    You must have a Business
or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS Support API.    If you call the AWS Support API
from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the
SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information about changing your
support plan, see AWS Support.

# Arguments
- `communication_body`: The communication body text that describes the issue. This text
  appears in the Description field on the AWS Support Center Create Case page.
- `subject`: The title of the AWS Support case. The title appears in the Subject field on
  the AWS Support Center Create Case page.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"attachmentSetId"`: The ID of a set of one or more attachments for the case. Create the
  set by using the AddAttachmentsToSet operation.
- `"categoryCode"`: The category of problem for the AWS Support case. You also use the
  DescribeServices operation to get the category code for a service. Each AWS service defines
  its own set of category codes.
- `"ccEmailAddresses"`: A list of email addresses that AWS Support copies on case
  correspondence. AWS Support identifies the account that creates the case when you specify
  your AWS credentials in an HTTP POST method or use the AWS SDKs.
- `"issueType"`: The type of issue for the case. You can specify customer-service or
  technical. If you don't specify a value, the default is technical.
- `"language"`: The language in which AWS Support handles the case. You must specify the
  ISO 639-1 code for the language parameter if you want support in that language. Currently,
  English (\"en\") and Japanese (\"ja\") are supported.
- `"serviceCode"`: The code for the AWS service. You can use the DescribeServices operation
  to get the possible serviceCode values.
- `"severityCode"`: A value that indicates the urgency of the case. This value determines
  the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You can use
  the DescribeSeverityLevels operation to get the possible values for severityCode.  For more
  information, see SeverityLevel and Choosing a Severity in the AWS Support User Guide.  The
  availability of severity levels depends on the support plan for the AWS account.

case management system when you add an attachment to a case or case communication.
Attachment IDs are returned in the AttachmentDetails objects that are returned by the

data types.   One or more nextToken values, which specify where to paginate the returned
records represented by the CaseDetails objects.   Case data is available for 12 months
after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request might return an
error.    You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS Support API.
