    AddAttachmentsToSet()

Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set.  An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that you add to a case or case communication. The set is available for 1 hour after it's created. The expiryTime returned in the response is when the set expires.     You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS Support API.    If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see AWS Support.   

# Required Parameters
- `attachments`: One or more attachments to add to the set. You can add up to three attachments per set. The size limit is 5 MB per attachment. In the Attachment object, use the data parameter to specify the contents of the attachment file. In the previous request syntax, the value for data appear as blob, which is represented as a base64-encoded string. The value for fileName is the name of the attachment, such as troubleshoot-screenshot.png.

# Optional Parameters
- `attachmentSetId`: The ID of the attachment set. If an attachmentSetId is not specified, a new attachment set is created, and the ID of the set is returned in the response. If an attachmentSetId is specified, the attachments are added to the specified set, if it exists.

    AddCommunicationToCase()

Adds additional customer communication to an AWS Support case. Use the caseId parameter to identify the case to which to add communication. You can list a set of email addresses to copy on the communication by using the ccEmailAddresses parameter. The communicationBody value contains the text of the communication.    You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS Support API.    If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see AWS Support.   

# Required Parameters
- `communicationBody`: The body of an email communication to add to the support case.

# Optional Parameters
- `attachmentSetId`: The ID of a set of one or more attachments for the communication to add to the case. Create the set by calling AddAttachmentsToSet 
- `caseId`: The AWS Support case ID requested or returned in the call. The case ID is an alphanumeric string formatted as shown in this example: case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47 
- `ccEmailAddresses`: The email addresses in the CC line of an email to be added to the support case.

"""
    CreateCase()

Creates a case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is similar to how you create a case in the AWS Support Center Create Case page. The AWS Support API doesn't support requesting service limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the following ways:    Submit a request from the AWS Support Center Create Case page.   Use the Service Quotas RequestServiceQuotaIncrease operation.   A successful CreateCase request returns an AWS Support case number. You can use the DescribeCases operation and specify the case number to get existing AWS Support cases. After you create a case, use the AddCommunicationToCase operation to add additional communication or attachments to an existing case. The caseId is separate from the displayId that appears in the AWS Support Center. Use the DescribeCases operation to get the displayId.    You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS Support API.    If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see AWS Support.   

# Required Parameters
- `communicationBody`: The communication body text that describes the issue. This text appears in the Description field on the AWS Support Center Create Case page.
- `subject`: The title of the AWS Support case. The title appears in the Subject field on the AWS Support Center Create Case page.

# Optional Parameters
- `attachmentSetId`: The ID of a set of one or more attachments for the case. Create the set by using the AddAttachmentsToSet operation.
- `categoryCode`: The category of problem for the AWS Support case. You also use the DescribeServices operation to get the category code for a service. Each AWS service defines its own set of category codes.
- `ccEmailAddresses`: A list of email addresses that AWS Support copies on case correspondence. AWS Support identifies the account that creates the case when you specify your AWS credentials in an HTTP POST method or use the AWS SDKs. 
- `issueType`: The type of issue for the case. You can specify customer-service or technical. If you don't specify a value, the default is technical.
- `language`: The language in which AWS Support handles the case. You must specify the ISO 639-1 code for the language parameter if you want support in that language. Currently, English (\"en\") and Japanese (\"ja\") are supported.
- `serviceCode`: The code for the AWS service. You can use the DescribeServices operation to get the possible serviceCode values.
- `severityCode`: A value that indicates the urgency of the case. This value determines the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You can use the DescribeSeverityLevels operation to get the possible values for severityCode.  For more information, see SeverityLevel and Choosing a Severity in the AWS Support User Guide.  The availability of severity levels depends on the support plan for the AWS account.

    DescribeAttachment()

Returns the attachment that has the specified ID. Attachments can include screenshots, error logs, or other files that describe your issue. Attachment IDs are generated by the case management system when you add an attachment to a case or case communication. Attachment IDs are returned in the AttachmentDetails objects that are returned by the DescribeCommunications operation.

    DescribeCases()

Returns a list of cases that you specify by passing one or more case IDs. You can use the afterTime and beforeTime parameters to filter the cases by date.
