    RegisterInstance()

Registers instances that were created outside of AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a specified stack.  We do not recommend using this action to register instances. The complete registration operation includes two tasks: installing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent on the instance, and registering the instance with the stack. RegisterInstance handles only the second step. You should instead use the AWS CLI register command, which performs the entire registration operation. For more information, see  Registering an Instance with an AWS OpsWorks Stacks Stack.  Registered instances have the same requirements as instances that are created by using the CreateInstance API. For example, registered instances must be running a supported Linux-based operating system, and they must have a supported instance type.

    CreateStack()

Creates a new stack. For more information, see Create a New Stack.  Required Permissions: To use this action, an IAM user must have an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions.

Required Parameters
{
  "ServiceRoleArn": "The stack's AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, which allows AWS OpsWorks Stacks to work with AWS resources on your behalf. You must set this parameter to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an existing IAM role. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers.",
  "DefaultInstanceProfileArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM profile that is the default profile for all of the stack's EC2 instances. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers.",
  "Name": "The stack name.",
  "Region": "The stack's AWS region, such as ap-south-1. For more information about Amazon regions, see Regions and Endpoints.  In the AWS CLI, this API maps to the --stack-region parameter. If the --stack-region parameter and the AWS CLI common parameter --region are set to the same value, the stack uses a regional endpoint. If the --stack-region parameter is not set, but the AWS CLI --region parameter is, this also results in a stack with a regional endpoint. However, if the --region parameter is set to us-east-1, and the --stack-region parameter is set to one of the following, then the stack uses a legacy or classic region: us-west-1, us-west-2, sa-east-1, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2. In this case, the actual API endpoint of the stack is in us-east-1. Only the preceding regions are supported as classic regions in the us-east-1 API endpoint. Because it is a best practice to choose the regional endpoint that is closest to where you manage AWS, we recommend that you use regional endpoints for new stacks. The AWS CLI common --region parameter always specifies a regional API endpoint; it cannot be used to specify a classic AWS OpsWorks Stacks region. "
