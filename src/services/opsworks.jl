    CloneStack()

Creates a clone of a specified stack. For more information, see Clone a Stack. By default, all parameters are set to the values used by the parent stack.  Required Permissions: To use this action, an IAM user must have an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions.

# Required Parameters
- `ServiceRoleArn`: The stack AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, which allows AWS OpsWorks Stacks to work with AWS resources on your behalf. You must set this parameter to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an existing IAM role. If you create a stack by using the AWS OpsWorks Stacks console, it creates the role for you. You can obtain an existing stack's IAM ARN programmatically by calling DescribePermissions. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers.  You must set this parameter to a valid service role ARN or the action will fail; there is no default value. You can specify the source stack's service role ARN, if you prefer, but you must do so explicitly. 
- `SourceStackId`: The source stack ID.

# Optional Parameters
- `AgentVersion`: The default AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent version. You have the following options:   Auto-update - Set this parameter to LATEST. AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically installs new agent versions on the stack's instances as soon as they are available.   Fixed version - Set this parameter to your preferred agent version. To update the agent version, you must edit the stack configuration and specify a new version. AWS OpsWorks Stacks then automatically installs that version on the stack's instances.   The default setting is LATEST. To specify an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call DescribeAgentVersions. AgentVersion cannot be set to Chef 12.2.  You can also specify an agent version when you create or update an instance, which overrides the stack's default setting. 
- `Attributes`: A list of stack attributes and values as key/value pairs to be added to the cloned stack.
- `ChefConfiguration`: A ChefConfiguration object that specifies whether to enable Berkshelf and the Berkshelf version on Chef 11.10 stacks. For more information, see Create a New Stack.
- `CloneAppIds`: A list of source stack app IDs to be included in the cloned stack.
- `ClonePermissions`: Whether to clone the source stack's permissions.
- `ConfigurationManager`: The configuration manager. When you clone a stack we recommend that you use the configuration manager to specify the Chef version: 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for Linux stacks, or 12.2 for Windows stacks. The default value for Linux stacks is currently 12.
- `CustomCookbooksSource`: Contains the information required to retrieve an app or cookbook from a repository. For more information, see Adding Apps or Cookbooks and Recipes.
- `CustomJson`: A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It is used to override the corresponding default stack configuration JSON values. The string should be in the following format:  \"{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}\"  For more information about custom JSON, see Use Custom JSON to Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes 
- `DefaultAvailabilityZone`: The cloned stack's default Availability Zone, which must be in the specified region. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints. If you also specify a value for DefaultSubnetId, the subnet must be in the same zone. For more information, see the VpcId parameter description. 
- `DefaultInstanceProfileArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM profile that is the default profile for all of the stack's EC2 instances. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers.
- `DefaultOs`: The stack's operating system, which must be set to one of the following.   A supported Linux operating system: An Amazon Linux version, such as Amazon Linux 2018.03, Amazon Linux 2017.09, Amazon Linux 2017.03, Amazon Linux 2016.09, Amazon Linux 2016.03, Amazon Linux 2015.09, or Amazon Linux 2015.03.   A supported Ubuntu operating system, such as Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.    CentOS Linux 7     Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7     Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Express, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Standard, or Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Web.   A custom AMI: Custom. You specify the custom AMI you want to use when you create instances. For more information about how to use custom AMIs with OpsWorks, see Using Custom AMIs.   The default option is the parent stack's operating system. For more information about supported operating systems, see AWS OpsWorks Stacks Operating Systems.  You can specify a different Linux operating system for the cloned stack, but you cannot change from Linux to Windows or Windows to Linux. 
- `DefaultRootDeviceType`: The default root device type. This value is used by default for all instances in the cloned stack, but you can override it when you create an instance. For more information, see Storage for the Root Device.
- `DefaultSshKeyName`: A default Amazon EC2 key pair name. The default value is none. If you specify a key pair name, AWS OpsWorks installs the public key on the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH client to log in to the instance. For more information, see  Using SSH to Communicate with an Instance and  Managing SSH Access. You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or no key pair, when you  create an instance. 
- `DefaultSubnetId`: The stack's default VPC subnet ID. This parameter is required if you specify a value for the VpcId parameter. All instances are launched into this subnet unless you specify otherwise when you create the instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone, the subnet must be in that zone. For information on default values and when this parameter is required, see the VpcId parameter description. 
- `HostnameTheme`: The stack's host name theme, with spaces are replaced by underscores. The theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances. By default, HostnameTheme is set to Layer_Dependent, which creates host names by appending integers to the layer's short name. The other themes are:    Baked_Goods     Clouds     Europe_Cities     Fruits     Greek_Deities_and_Titans     Legendary_creatures_from_Japan     Planets_and_Moons     Roman_Deities     Scottish_Islands     US_Cities     Wild_Cats    To obtain a generated host name, call GetHostNameSuggestion, which returns a host name based on the current theme.
- `Name`: The cloned stack name.
- `Region`: The cloned stack AWS region, such as \"ap-northeast-2\". For more information about AWS regions, see Regions and Endpoints.
- `UseCustomCookbooks`: Whether to use custom cookbooks.
- `UseOpsworksSecurityGroups`: Whether to associate the AWS OpsWorks Stacks built-in security groups with the stack's layers. AWS OpsWorks Stacks provides a standard set of built-in security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. With UseOpsworksSecurityGroups you can instead provide your own custom security groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with each layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it but you cannot delete the built-in security group.   False - AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create appropriate Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create. However, you can still manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on creation; custom security groups are required only for those layers that need custom settings.   For more information, see Create a New Stack.
- `VpcId`: The ID of the VPC that the cloned stack is to be launched into. It must be in the specified region. All instances are launched into this VPC, and you cannot change the ID later.   If your account supports EC2 Classic, the default value is no VPC.   If your account does not support EC2 Classic, the default value is the default VPC for the specified region.   If the VPC ID corresponds to a default VPC and you have specified either the DefaultAvailabilityZone or the DefaultSubnetId parameter only, AWS OpsWorks Stacks infers the value of the other parameter. If you specify neither parameter, AWS OpsWorks Stacks sets these parameters to the first valid Availability Zone for the specified region and the corresponding default VPC subnet ID, respectively.  If you specify a nondefault VPC ID, note the following:   It must belong to a VPC in your account that is in the specified region.   You must specify a value for DefaultSubnetId.   For more information about how to use AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a VPC, see Running a Stack in a VPC. For more information about default VPC and EC2 Classic, see Supported Platforms.

    CreateLayer()

Creates a layer. For more information, see How to Create a Layer.  You should use CreateLayer for noncustom layer types such as PHP App Server only if the stack does not have an existing layer of that type. A stack can have at most one instance of each noncustom layer; if you attempt to create a second instance, CreateLayer fails. A stack can have an arbitrary number of custom layers, so you can call CreateLayer as many times as you like for that layer type.   Required Permissions: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see Managing User Permissions.

# Required Parameters
- `Name`: The layer name, which is used by the console.

    CreateStack()

Creates a new stack. For more information, see Create a New Stack.  Required Permissions: To use this action, an IAM user must have an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions.

# Required Parameters
- `DefaultInstanceProfileArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM profile that is the default profile for all of the stack's EC2 instances. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers.
- `Name`: The stack name.
- `Region`: The stack's AWS region, such as ap-south-1. For more information about Amazon regions, see Regions and Endpoints.  In the AWS CLI, this API maps to the --stack-region parameter. If the --stack-region parameter and the AWS CLI common parameter --region are set to the same value, the stack uses a regional endpoint. If the --stack-region parameter is not set, but the AWS CLI --region parameter is, this also results in a stack with a regional endpoint. However, if the --region parameter is set to us-east-1, and the --stack-region parameter is set to one of the following, then the stack uses a legacy or classic region: us-west-1, us-west-2, sa-east-1, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2. In this case, the actual API endpoint of the stack is in us-east-1. Only the preceding regions are supported as classic regions in the us-east-1 API endpoint. Because it is a best practice to choose the regional endpoint that is closest to where you manage AWS, we recommend that you use regional endpoints for new stacks. The AWS CLI common --region parameter always specifies a regional API endpoint; it cannot be used to specify a classic AWS OpsWorks Stacks region. 
- `ServiceRoleArn`: The stack's AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, which allows AWS OpsWorks Stacks to work with AWS resources on your behalf. You must set this parameter to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an existing IAM role. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers.

# Optional Parameters
- `AgentVersion`: The default AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent version. You have the following options:   Auto-update - Set this parameter to LATEST. AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically installs new agent versions on the stack's instances as soon as they are available.   Fixed version - Set this parameter to your preferred agent version. To update the agent version, you must edit the stack configuration and specify a new version. AWS OpsWorks Stacks then automatically installs that version on the stack's instances.   The default setting is the most recent release of the agent. To specify an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call DescribeAgentVersions. AgentVersion cannot be set to Chef 12.2.  You can also specify an agent version when you create or update an instance, which overrides the stack's default setting. 
- `Attributes`: One or more user-defined key-value pairs to be added to the stack attributes.
- `ChefConfiguration`: A ChefConfiguration object that specifies whether to enable Berkshelf and the Berkshelf version on Chef 11.10 stacks. For more information, see Create a New Stack.
- `ConfigurationManager`: The configuration manager. When you create a stack we recommend that you use the configuration manager to specify the Chef version: 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for Linux stacks, or 12.2 for Windows stacks. The default value for Linux stacks is currently 12.
- `CustomCookbooksSource`: Contains the information required to retrieve an app or cookbook from a repository. For more information, see Adding Apps or Cookbooks and Recipes.
- `CustomJson`: A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It can be used to override the corresponding default stack configuration attribute values or to pass data to recipes. The string should be in the following format:  \"{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}\"  For more information about custom JSON, see Use Custom JSON to Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes.
- `DefaultAvailabilityZone`: The stack's default Availability Zone, which must be in the specified region. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints. If you also specify a value for DefaultSubnetId, the subnet must be in the same zone. For more information, see the VpcId parameter description. 
- `DefaultOs`: The stack's default operating system, which is installed on every instance unless you specify a different operating system when you create the instance. You can specify one of the following.   A supported Linux operating system: An Amazon Linux version, such as Amazon Linux 2018.03, Amazon Linux 2017.09, Amazon Linux 2017.03, Amazon Linux 2016.09, Amazon Linux 2016.03, Amazon Linux 2015.09, or Amazon Linux 2015.03.   A supported Ubuntu operating system, such as Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.    CentOS Linux 7     Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7    A supported Windows operating system, such as Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Express, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Standard, or Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Web.   A custom AMI: Custom. You specify the custom AMI you want to use when you create instances. For more information, see  Using Custom AMIs.   The default option is the current Amazon Linux version. For more information about supported operating systems, see AWS OpsWorks Stacks Operating Systems.
- `DefaultRootDeviceType`: The default root device type. This value is the default for all instances in the stack, but you can override it when you create an instance. The default option is instance-store. For more information, see Storage for the Root Device.
- `DefaultSshKeyName`: A default Amazon EC2 key pair name. The default value is none. If you specify a key pair name, AWS OpsWorks installs the public key on the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH client to log in to the instance. For more information, see  Using SSH to Communicate with an Instance and  Managing SSH Access. You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or no key pair, when you  create an instance. 
- `DefaultSubnetId`: The stack's default VPC subnet ID. This parameter is required if you specify a value for the VpcId parameter. All instances are launched into this subnet unless you specify otherwise when you create the instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone, the subnet must be in that zone. For information on default values and when this parameter is required, see the VpcId parameter description. 
- `HostnameTheme`: The stack's host name theme, with spaces replaced by underscores. The theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances. By default, HostnameTheme is set to Layer_Dependent, which creates host names by appending integers to the layer's short name. The other themes are:    Baked_Goods     Clouds     Europe_Cities     Fruits     Greek_Deities_and_Titans     Legendary_creatures_from_Japan     Planets_and_Moons     Roman_Deities     Scottish_Islands     US_Cities     Wild_Cats    To obtain a generated host name, call GetHostNameSuggestion, which returns a host name based on the current theme.
- `UseCustomCookbooks`: Whether the stack uses custom cookbooks.
- `UseOpsworksSecurityGroups`: Whether to associate the AWS OpsWorks Stacks built-in security groups with the stack's layers. AWS OpsWorks Stacks provides a standard set of built-in security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. With UseOpsworksSecurityGroups you can instead provide your own custom security groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with each layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it, but you cannot delete the built-in security group.   False - AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create appropriate EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create. However, you can still manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on creation; custom security groups are required only for those layers that need custom settings.   For more information, see Create a New Stack.
- `VpcId`: The ID of the VPC that the stack is to be launched into. The VPC must be in the stack's region. All instances are launched into this VPC. You cannot change the ID later.   If your account supports EC2-Classic, the default value is no VPC.   If your account does not support EC2-Classic, the default value is the default VPC for the specified region.   If the VPC ID corresponds to a default VPC and you have specified either the DefaultAvailabilityZone or the DefaultSubnetId parameter only, AWS OpsWorks Stacks infers the value of the other parameter. If you specify neither parameter, AWS OpsWorks Stacks sets these parameters to the first valid Availability Zone for the specified region and the corresponding default VPC subnet ID, respectively. If you specify a nondefault VPC ID, note the following:   It must belong to a VPC in your account that is in the specified region.   You must specify a value for DefaultSubnetId.   For more information about how to use AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a VPC, see Running a Stack in a VPC. For more information about default VPC and EC2-Classic, see Supported Platforms.

# Required Parameters
- `InstanceId`: The instance ID.

# Optional Parameters
- `AgentVersion`: The default AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent version. You have the following options:    INHERIT - Use the stack's default agent version setting.    version_number - Use the specified agent version. This value overrides the stack's default setting. To update the agent version, you must edit the instance configuration and specify a new version. AWS OpsWorks Stacks then automatically installs that version on the instance.   The default setting is INHERIT. To specify an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call DescribeAgentVersions. AgentVersion cannot be set to Chef 12.2.
- `AmiId`: The ID of the AMI that was used to create the instance. The value of this parameter must be the same AMI ID that the instance is already using. You cannot apply a new AMI to an instance by running UpdateInstance. UpdateInstance does not work on instances that are using custom AMIs. 
- `Architecture`: The instance architecture. Instance types do not necessarily support both architectures. For a list of the architectures that are supported by the different instance types, see Instance Families and Types.
- `AutoScalingType`: For load-based or time-based instances, the type. Windows stacks can use only time-based instances.
- `EbsOptimized`: This property cannot be updated.
- `Hostname`: The instance host name.
- `InstallUpdatesOnBoot`: Whether to install operating system and package updates when the instance boots. The default value is true. To control when updates are installed, set this value to false. You must then update your instances manually by using CreateDeployment to run the update_dependencies stack command or by manually running yum (Amazon Linux) or apt-get (Ubuntu) on the instances.   We strongly recommend using the default value of true, to ensure that your instances have the latest security updates. 
- `InstanceType`: The instance type, such as t2.micro. For a list of supported instance types, open the stack in the console, choose Instances, and choose + Instance. The Size list contains the currently supported types. For more information, see Instance Families and Types. The parameter values that you use to specify the various types are in the API Name column of the Available Instance Types table.

A custom AMI: Custom. You specify the custom AMI you want to use when you create instances. For more information about how to use custom AMIs with OpsWorks, see Using Custom AMIs.   The default option is the stack's current operating system. For more information about supported operating systems, see AWS OpsWorks Stacks Operating Systems.
- `DefaultRootDeviceType`: The default root device type. This value is used by default for all instances in the stack, but you can override it when you create an instance. For more information, see Storage for the Root Device.
- `DefaultSshKeyName`: A default Amazon EC2 key-pair name. The default value is none. If you specify a key-pair name, AWS OpsWorks Stacks installs the public key on the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH client to log in to the instance. For more information, see  Using SSH to Communicate with an Instance and  Managing SSH Access. You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or no key pair, when you  create an instance. 
- `DefaultSubnetId`: The stack's default VPC subnet ID. This parameter is required if you specify a value for the VpcId parameter. All instances are launched into this subnet unless you specify otherwise when you create the instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone, the subnet must be in that zone. For information on default values and when this parameter is required, see the VpcId parameter description. 
- `HostnameTheme`: The stack's new host name theme, with spaces replaced by underscores. The theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances. By default, HostnameTheme is set to Layer_Dependent, which creates host names by appending integers to the layer's short name. The other themes are:    Baked_Goods     Clouds     Europe_Cities     Fruits     Greek_Deities_and_Titans     Legendary_creatures_from_Japan     Planets_and_Moons     Roman_Deities     Scottish_Islands     US_Cities     Wild_Cats    To obtain a generated host name, call GetHostNameSuggestion, which returns a host name based on the current theme.
- `Name`: The stack's new name.
- `ServiceRoleArn`: Do not use this parameter. You cannot update a stack's service role.
- `UseCustomCookbooks`: Whether the stack uses custom cookbooks.
- `UseOpsworksSecurityGroups`: Whether to associate the AWS OpsWorks Stacks built-in security groups with the stack's layers. AWS OpsWorks Stacks provides a standard set of built-in security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups allows you to provide your own custom security groups instead of using the built-in groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with each layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it, but you cannot delete the built-in security group.   False - AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create appropriate EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create. However, you can still manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on. Custom security groups are required only for those layers that need custom settings.
