    AssociateDRTLogBucket()

Authorizes the DDoS Response Team (DRT) to access the specified Amazon S3 bucket containing your AWS WAF logs. You can associate up to 10 Amazon S3 buckets with your subscription. To use the services of the DRT and make an AssociateDRTLogBucket request, you must be subscribed to the Business Support plan or the Enterprise Support plan.

# Required Parameters
- `LogBucket`: The Amazon S3 bucket that contains your AWS WAF logs.

    AssociateDRTRole()

Authorizes the DDoS Response Team (DRT), using the specified role, to access your AWS account to assist with DDoS attack mitigation during potential attacks. This enables the DRT to inspect your AWS WAF configuration and create or update AWS WAF rules and web ACLs. You can associate only one RoleArn with your subscription. If you submit an AssociateDRTRole request for an account that already has an associated role, the new RoleArn will replace the existing RoleArn.  Prior to making the AssociateDRTRole request, you must attach the AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy managed policy to the role you will specify in the request. For more information see Attaching and Detaching IAM Policies. The role must also trust the service principal  drt.shield.amazonaws.com. For more information, see IAM JSON Policy Elements: Principal. The DRT will have access only to your AWS WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you authorize the DRT to inspect your AWS WAF and Shield configuration and create and update AWS WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The DRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you. You must have the iam:PassRole permission to make an AssociateDRTRole request. For more information, see Granting a User Permissions to Pass a Role to an AWS Service.  To use the services of the DRT and make an AssociateDRTRole request, you must be subscribed to the Business Support plan or the Enterprise Support plan.

# Required Parameters
- `RoleArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role the DRT will use to access your AWS account. Prior to making the AssociateDRTRole request, you must attach the AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy managed policy to this role. For more information see Attaching and Detaching IAM Policies.

    AssociateHealthCheck()

Adds health-based detection to the Shield Advanced protection for a resource.

    AssociateProactiveEngagementDetails()

Initializes proactive engagement and sets the list of contacts for the DDoS Response Team (DRT) to use. You must provide at least one phone number in the emergency contact list.  After you have initialized proactive engagement using this call, to disable or enable proactive engagement, use the calls DisableProactiveEngagement and EnableProactiveEngagement.   This call defines the list of email addresses and phone numbers that the DDoS Response Team (DRT) can use to contact you for escalations to the DRT and to initiate proactive customer support. The contacts that you provide in the request replace any contacts that were already defined. If you already have contacts defined and want to use them, retrieve the list using DescribeEmergencyContactSettings and then provide it to this call.  

# Required Parameters
- `EmergencyContactList`: A list of email addresses and phone numbers that the DDoS Response Team (DRT) can use to contact you for escalations to the DRT and to initiate proactive customer support.
