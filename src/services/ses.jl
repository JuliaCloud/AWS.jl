    SendBulkTemplatedEmail()

Composes an email message to multiple destinations. The message body is created using an email template. In order to send email using the SendBulkTemplatedEmail operation, your call to the API must meet the following requirements:   The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the CreateTemplate operation.   The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.   If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.    The maximum message size is 10 MB.   Each Destination parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain), the entire message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.   The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call the SendBulkTemplatedEmail operation several times to send the message to each group.   The number of destinations you can contact in a single call to the API may be limited by your account's maximum sending rate.  

# Required Parameters
- `Destinations`: One or more Destination objects. All of the recipients in a Destination will receive the same version of the email. You can specify up to 50 Destination objects within a Destinations array.
- `Source`: The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.  Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in RFC6531. For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=. 
- `Template`: The template to use when sending this email.

# Optional Parameters
- `ConfigurationSetName`: The name of the configuration set to use when you send an email using SendBulkTemplatedEmail.
- `DefaultTags`: A list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an email that you send to a destination using SendBulkTemplatedEmail.
- `DefaultTemplateData`: A list of replacement values to apply to the template when replacement data is not specified in a Destination object. These values act as a default or fallback option when no other data is available. The template data is a JSON object, typically consisting of key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the email template.
- `ReplyToAddresses`: The reply-to email address(es) for the message. If the recipient replies to the message, each reply-to address will receive the reply.
- `ReturnPath`: The email address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the recipient's ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email address specified by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. 
- `ReturnPathArn`: This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the ReturnPath parameter. For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com, then you would specify the ReturnPathArn to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com.

    SendRawEmail()

Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. This operation is more flexible than the SendEmail API operation. When you use the SendRawEmail operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send messages that include attachments. The SendRawEmail operation has the following requirements:   You can only send email from verified email addresses or domains. If you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the operation results in an \"Email address not verified\" error.   If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to addresses that are associated with the Amazon SES mailbox simulator.   The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.   Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.   If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain), Amazon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid.   Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group.   Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see MIME Encoding in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the SendRawEmail operation:   Although you can customize the message headers when using the SendRawEmail operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own Message-ID and Date headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.   If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, SendRawEmail enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters SourceArn, FromArn, and/or ReturnPathArn to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:    X-SES-SOURCE-ARN     X-SES-FROM-ARN     X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN     Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.  If you only specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified. For more information about sending authorization, see the Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.    For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your sending quota). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

- `RawMessage`: The raw email message itself. The message has to meet the following criteria:   The message has to contain a header and a body, separated by a blank line.   All of the required header fields must be present in the message.   Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted properly.   Attachments must be of a content type that Amazon SES supports. For a list on unsupported content types, see Unsupported Attachment Types in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   The entire message must be base64-encoded.   If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, we highly recommend that you encode that content. For more information, see Sending Raw Email in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   Per RFC 5321, the maximum length of each line of text, including the &lt;CRLF&gt;, must not exceed 1,000 characters.  

# Optional Parameters
- `ConfigurationSetName`: The name of the configuration set to use when you send an email using SendRawEmail.
- `Destinations`: A list of destinations for the message, consisting of To:, CC:, and BCC: addresses.
- `FromArn`: This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to specify a particular \"From\" address in the header of the raw email. Instead of using this parameter, you can use the X-header X-SES-FROM-ARN in the raw message of the email. If you use both the FromArn parameter and the corresponding X-header, Amazon SES uses the value of the FromArn parameter.  For information about when to use this parameter, see the description of SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. 
- `ReturnPathArn`: This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the ReturnPath parameter. For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com, then you would specify the ReturnPathArn to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com. Instead of using this parameter, you can use the X-header X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN in the raw message of the email. If you use both the ReturnPathArn parameter and the corresponding X-header, Amazon SES uses the value of the ReturnPathArn parameter.  For information about when to use this parameter, see the description of SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. 
- `Source`: The identity's email address. If you do not provide a value for this parameter, you must specify a \"From\" address in the raw text of the message. (You can also specify both.)  Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described inRFC6531. For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=.  If you specify the Source parameter and have feedback forwarding enabled, then bounces and complaints will be sent to this email address. This takes precedence over any Return-Path header that you might include in the raw text of the message.
- `SourceArn`: This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the Source parameter. For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from user@example.com, then you would specify the SourceArn to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the Source to be user@example.com. Instead of using this parameter, you can use the X-header X-SES-SOURCE-ARN in the raw message of the email. If you use both the SourceArn parameter and the corresponding X-header, Amazon SES uses the value of the SourceArn parameter.  For information about when to use this parameter, see the description of SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. 
- `Tags`: A list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an email that you send using SendRawEmail. Tags correspond to characteristics of the email that you define, so that you can publish email sending events.

"""
    SendTemplatedEmail()

Composes an email message using an email template and immediately queues it for sending. In order to send email using the SendTemplatedEmail operation, your call to the API must meet the following requirements:   The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the CreateTemplate operation.   The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.   If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.    The maximum message size is 10 MB.   Calls to the SendTemplatedEmail operation may only include one Destination parameter. A destination is a set of recipients who will receive the same version of the email. The Destination parameter can include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.   The Destination parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain), the entire message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.    If your call to the SendTemplatedEmail operation includes all of the required parameters, Amazon SES accepts it and returns a Message ID. However, if Amazon SES can't render the email because the template contains errors, it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because it already accepted the message, Amazon SES doesn't return a message stating that it was unable to send the email. For these reasons, we highly recommend that you set up Amazon SES to send you notifications when Rendering Failure events occur. For more information, see Sending Personalized Email Using the Amazon SES API in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide. 

# Required Parameters
- `Destination`: The destination for this email, composed of To:, CC:, and BCC: fields. A Destination can include up to 50 recipients across these three fields.
- `Source`: The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.  Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in RFC6531. For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described inRFC 2047. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=. 
- `Template`: The template to use when sending this email.
- `TemplateData`: A list of replacement values to apply to the template. This parameter is a JSON object, typically consisting of key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the email template.

# Optional Parameters
- `ConfigurationSetName`: The name of the configuration set to use when you send an email using SendTemplatedEmail.
- `ReplyToAddresses`: The reply-to email address(es) for the message. If the recipient replies to the message, each reply-to address will receive the reply.
- `ReturnPath`: The email address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the recipient's ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email address specified by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. 
- `ReturnPathArn`: This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the ReturnPath parameter. For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com, then you would specify the ReturnPathArn to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com. For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.
- `SourceArn`: This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the Source parameter. For example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from user@example.com, then you would specify the SourceArn to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and the Source to be user@example.com.

For email addresses (for example, user@example.com), you can only enable DKIM signing if the corresponding domain (in this case, example.com) has been set up to use Easy DKIM.  You can enable DKIM signing for an identity at any time after you start the verification process for the identity, even if the verification process isn't complete.  You can execute this operation no more than once per second. For more information about Easy DKIM signing, go to the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

    VerifyDomainDkim()

Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity.  When you execute the VerifyDomainDkim operation, the domain that you specify is added to the list of identities that are associated with your account. This is true even if you haven't already associated the domain with your account by using the VerifyDomainIdentity operation. However, you can't send email from the domain until you either successfully verify it or you successfully set up DKIM for it.  You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is authenticated using DKIM. To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following values:    Name: token._domainkey.example.com     Type: CNAME    Value: token.dkim.amazonses.com   In the preceding example, replace token with one of the tokens that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace example.com with your domain. Repeat this process for each token that's generated by this operation. You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

# Required Parameters
- `Domain`: The name of the domain to be verified for Easy DKIM signing.
