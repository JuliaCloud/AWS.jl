    create_platform_application(attributes, name, platform)
    create_platform_application(attributes, name, platform, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push notification services,
such as APNS and GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), to which devices and mobile apps may
register. You must specify PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential attributes when using
the CreatePlatformApplication action.  PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential are
received from the notification service.   For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is client id and
PlatformCredential is client secret.   For Baidu, PlatformPrincipal is API key and
PlatformCredential is secret key.   For APNS and APNS_SANDBOX, PlatformPrincipal is SSL
certificate and PlatformCredential is private key.   For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging),
there is no PlatformPrincipal and the PlatformCredential is API key.   For MPNS,
PlatformPrincipal is TLS certificate and PlatformCredential is private key.   For WNS,
PlatformPrincipal is Package Security Identifier and PlatformCredential is secret key.
You can use the returned PlatformApplicationArn as an attribute for the
CreatePlatformEndpoint action.

# Arguments
- `attributes`: For a list of attributes, see SetPlatformApplicationAttributes.
- `name`: Application names must be made up of only uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters,
  numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods, and must be between 1 and 256 characters long.

"""
    create_platform_endpoint(platform_application_arn, token)
    create_platform_endpoint(platform_application_arn, token, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification
services, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and APNS. CreatePlatformEndpoint requires
the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from CreatePlatformApplication. You can use the
returned EndpointArn to send a message to a mobile app or by the Subscribe action for
subscription to a topic. The CreatePlatformEndpoint action is idempotent, so if the
requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that
endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see Using
Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications.  When using CreatePlatformEndpoint with Baidu, two
attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId. The token field must also contain the
ChannelId. For more information, see Creating an Amazon SNS Endpoint for Baidu.

# Arguments
- `platform_application_arn`: PlatformApplicationArn returned from
  CreatePlatformApplication is used to create a an endpoint.
- `token`: Unique identifier created by the notification service for an app on a device.
  The specific name for Token will vary, depending on which notification service is being
  used. For example, when using APNS as the notification service, you need the device token.
  Alternatively, when using GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) or ADM, the device token
  equivalent is called the registration ID.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Attributes"`: For a list of attributes, see SetEndpointAttributes.
- `"CustomUserData"`: Arbitrary user data to associate with the endpoint. Amazon SNS does
  not use this data. The data must be in UTF-8 format and less than 2KB.

Adds a destination phone number to an account in the SMS sandbox and sends a one-time
password (OTP) to that phone number. When you start using Amazon SNS to send SMS messages,
your account is in the SMS sandbox. The SMS sandbox provides a safe environment for you to
try Amazon SNS features without risking your reputation as an SMS sender. While your
account is in the SMS sandbox, you can use all of the features of Amazon SNS. However, you
can send SMS messages only to verified destination phone numbers. For more information,
including how to move out of the sandbox to send messages without restrictions, see SMS
sandbox in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `phone_number`: The destination phone number to verify. On verification, Amazon SNS adds
  this phone number to the list of verified phone numbers that you can send SMS messages to.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"LanguageCode"`: The language to use for sending the OTP. The default value is en-US.

"""
    create_topic(name)
    create_topic(name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a topic to which notifications can be published. Users can create at most 100,000
standard topics (at most 1,000 FIFO topics). For more information, see Creating an Amazon
SNS topic in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide. This action is idempotent, so if the requester
already owns a topic with the specified name, that topic's ARN is returned without creating
a new topic.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the topic you want to create. Constraints: Topic names must be made
  up of only uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and
  must be between 1 and 256 characters long. For a FIFO (first-in-first-out) topic, the name
  must end with the .fifo suffix.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Attributes"`: A map of attributes with their corresponding values. The following lists
  the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the CreateTopic
  action uses:    DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed
  deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.    DisplayName – The display name to use for a topic with
  SMS subscriptions.    FifoTopic – Set to true to create a FIFO topic.    Policy – The
  policy that defines who can access your topic. By default, only the topic owner can publish
  or subscribe to the topic.   The following attribute applies only to server-side
  encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master
  key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. For more
  examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference.    The following
  attributes apply only to FIFO topics:    FifoTopic – When this is set to true, a FIFO
  topic is created.    ContentBasedDeduplication – Enables content-based deduplication for
  FIFO topics.   By default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false. If you create a FIFO
  topic and this attribute is false, you must specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId
  parameter for the Publish action.    When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true, Amazon
  SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the
  message (but not the attributes of the message). (Optional) To override the generated
  value, you can specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish
  action.
- `"Tags"`: The list of tags to add to a new topic.  To be able to tag a topic on creation,
  you must have the sns:CreateTopic and sns:TagResource permissions.

"""
    publish(message)
    publish(message, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic, a text message (SMS message) directly to a phone
number, or a message to a mobile platform endpoint (when you specify the TargetArn). If you
send a message to a topic, Amazon SNS delivers the message to each endpoint that is
subscribed to the topic. The format of the message depends on the notification protocol for
each subscribed endpoint. When a messageId is returned, the message has been saved and
Amazon SNS will attempt to deliver it shortly. To use the Publish action for sending a
message to a mobile endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must
specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is returned when
making a call with the CreatePlatformEndpoint action.  For more information about
formatting messages, see Send Custom Platform-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile
Devices.   You can publish messages only to topics and endpoints in the same Region.

# Arguments
- `message`: The message you want to send. If you are publishing to a topic and you want to
  send the same message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a
  String value. If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the
  value of the MessageStructure parameter to json and use a JSON object for the Message
  parameter.   Constraints:   With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded
  strings and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144 characters).   For SMS, each
  message can contain up to 140 characters. This character limit depends on the encoding
  schema. For example, an SMS message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters,
  or 70 UCS-2 characters. If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS
  sends the message as multiple messages, each fitting within the size limit. Messages aren't
  truncated mid-word but are cut off at whole-word boundaries. The total size limit for a
  single SMS Publish action is 1,600 characters.   JSON-specific constraints:   Keys in the
  JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string
  values.   The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages.
   Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for
  sending).   Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, \"\", is allowed).
  Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple
  protocols may limit message sizes).   Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.
  Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored.   Duplicate keys
  are not allowed.   Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause
  the Publish call to return an error (no partial delivery).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"MessageAttributes"`: Message attributes for Publish action.
- `"MessageDeduplicationId"`: This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out)
  topics. The MessageDeduplicationId can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z,
  0-9) and punctuation (!\"#%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[]^_`{|}~). Every message must have a
  unique MessageDeduplicationId, which is a token used for deduplication of sent messages. If
  a message with a particular MessageDeduplicationId is sent successfully, any message sent
  with the same MessageDeduplicationId during the 5-minute deduplication interval is treated
  as a duplicate.  If the topic has ContentBasedDeduplication set, the system generates a
  MessageDeduplicationId based on the contents of the message. Your MessageDeduplicationId
  overrides the generated one.
- `"MessageGroupId"`: This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The
  MessageGroupId can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and
  punctuation (!\"#%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[]^_`{|}~). The MessageGroupId is a tag that
  specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the
  same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message
  groups might be processed out of order). Every message must include a MessageGroupId.
- `"MessageStructure"`: Set MessageStructure to json if you want to send a different
  message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short
  message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set
  MessageStructure to json, the value of the Message parameter must:    be a syntactically
  valid JSON object; and   contain at least a top-level JSON key of \"default\" with a value
  that is a string.   You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to
  send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., \"http\"). Valid value: json
- `"PhoneNumber"`: The phone number to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use E.164
  format. If you don't specify a value for the PhoneNumber parameter, you must specify a
  value for the TargetArn or TopicArn parameters.
- `"Subject"`: Optional parameter to be used as the \"Subject\" line when the message is
  delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be included, if present, in the standard
  JSON messages delivered to other endpoints. Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that
  begins with a letter, number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control
  characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.
- `"TargetArn"`: If you don't specify a value for the TargetArn parameter, you must specify
  a value for the PhoneNumber or TopicArn parameters.
- `"TopicArn"`: The topic you want to publish to. If you don't specify a value for the
  TopicArn parameter, you must specify a value for the PhoneNumber or TargetArn parameters.

    set_smsattributes(attributes)
    set_smsattributes(attributes, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Use this request to set the default settings for sending SMS messages and receiving daily
SMS usage reports. You can override some of these settings for a single message when you
use the Publish action with the MessageAttributes.entry.N parameter. For more information,
see Publishing to a mobile phone in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.  To use this operation,
you must grant the Amazon SNS service principal (sns.amazonaws.com) permission to perform
the s3:ListBucket action.

# Arguments
- `attributes`: The default settings for sending SMS messages from your account. You can
  set values for the following attribute names:  MonthlySpendLimit – The maximum amount in
  USD that you are willing to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS
  determines that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this limit, it stops
  sending SMS messages within minutes.  Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes
  of the limit being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you
  will incur costs that exceed your limit.  By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum
  allowed by Amazon SNS. If you want to raise the limit, submit an SNS Limit Increase case.
  For New limit value, enter your desired monthly spend limit. In the Use Case Description
  field, explain that you are requesting an SMS monthly spend limit increase.
  DeliveryStatusIAMRole – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon SNS to write logs
  about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS
  writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for
  failure (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.
  DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate – The percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which
  Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100.
  For example, to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to 0. To write logs
  for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to 10.  DefaultSenderID – A string, such as
  your business brand, that is displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for
  sender IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric characters, and it
  must contain at least one letter.  DefaultSMSType – The type of SMS message that you will
  send by default. You can assign the following values:    Promotional – (Default)
  Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery
  to incur the lowest cost.    Transactional – Critical messages that support customer
  transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication. Amazon SNS
  optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest reliability.    UsageReportS3Bucket
  – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS.
  Each day, Amazon SNS will deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report
  includes the following information for each SMS message that was successfully delivered by
  your account:   Time that the message was published (in UTC)   Message ID   Destination
  phone number   Message type   Delivery status   Message price (in USD)   Part number (a
  message is split into multiple parts if it is too long for a single message)   Total number
  of parts   To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the Amazon SNS
  service principal to perform the s3:PutObject and s3:GetBucketLocation actions. For an
  example bucket policy and usage report, see Monitoring SMS Activity in the Amazon SNS
  Developer Guide.

  to the topic.    RawMessageDelivery – When set to true, enables raw message delivery to
  Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the need for the endpoints to process JSON
  formatting, which is otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata.    RedrivePolicy – When
  specified, sends undeliverable messages to the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue.
  Messages that can't be delivered due to client errors (for example, when the subscribed
  endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the service that powers the
  subscribed endpoint becomes unavailable) are held in the dead-letter queue for further

# Arguments
- `attribute_name`: A map of attributes with their corresponding values. The following
  lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the
  SetTopicAttributes action uses:    DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon

  access your topic. By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.
   The following attribute applies only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId – The
  ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom
  CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. For more examples, see KeyId in the Key
  Management Service API Reference.    The following attribute applies only to FIFO topics:
   ContentBasedDeduplication – Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.   By
  default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false. If you create a FIFO topic and this
  attribute is false, you must specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for

- `"Endpoint"`: The endpoint that you want to receive notifications. Endpoints vary by
  protocol:   For the http protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning with http://.
  For the https protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning with https://.   For the
  email protocol, the endpoint is an email address.   For the email-json protocol, the
  endpoint is an email address.   For the sms protocol, the endpoint is a phone number of an
  SMS-enabled device.   For the sqs protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon SQS queue.
    For the application protocol, the endpoint is the EndpointArn of a mobile app and device.
    For the lambda protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Lambda function.   For the
  firehose protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery
  stream.
- `"ReturnSubscriptionArn"`: Sets whether the response from the Subscribe request includes
  the subscription ARN, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed. If you set this
  parameter to true, the response includes the ARN in all cases, even if the subscription is
  not yet confirmed. In addition to the ARN for confirmed subscriptions, the response also
  includes the pending subscription ARN value for subscriptions that aren't yet confirmed. A
