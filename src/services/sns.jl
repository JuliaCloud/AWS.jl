    CreatePlatformEndpoint()

Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as FCM and APNS. CreatePlatformEndpoint requires the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from CreatePlatformApplication. The EndpointArn that is returned when using CreatePlatformEndpoint can then be used by the Publish action to send a message to a mobile app or by the Subscribe action for subscription to a topic. The CreatePlatformEndpoint action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications.  When using CreatePlatformEndpoint with Baidu, two attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId. The token field must also contain the ChannelId. For more information, see Creating an Amazon SNS Endpoint for Baidu.

"""
    Publish()

Sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic or sends a text message (SMS message) directly to a phone number.  If you send a message to a topic, Amazon SNS delivers the message to each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint. When a messageId is returned, the message has been saved and Amazon SNS will attempt to deliver it shortly. To use the Publish action for sending a message to a mobile endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is returned when making a call with the CreatePlatformEndpoint action.  For more information about formatting messages, see Send Custom Platform-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile Devices. 

Required Parameters
{
  "Message": "The message you want to send. If you are publishing to a topic and you want to send the same message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a String value. If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the value of the MessageStructure parameter to json and use a JSON object for the Message parameter.   Constraints:   With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144 characters).   For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This character limit depends on the encoding schema. For example, an SMS message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters, or 70 UCS-2 characters. If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS sends the message as multiple messages, each fitting within the size limit. Messages aren't truncated mid-word but are cut off at whole-word boundaries. The total size limit for a single SMS Publish action is 1,600 characters.   JSON-specific constraints:   Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string values.   The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages.   Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for sending).   Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, \"\", is allowed).   Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).   Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.   Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored.   Duplicate keys are not allowed.   Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the Publish call to return an error (no partial delivery).  "

Optional Parameters
{

Amazon SNS interprets tags as character strings.   Tags are case-sensitive.   A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.   Tagging actions are limited to 10 TPS per AWS account, per AWS region. If your application requires a higher throughput, file a technical support request.  

Required Parameters
{
  "ResourceArn": "The ARN of the topic to which to add tags.",
  "Tags": "The tags to be added to the specified topic. A tag consists of a required key and an optional value."
}

"""
    Unsubscribe()

Deletes a subscription. If the subscription requires authentication for deletion, only the owner of the subscription or the topic's owner can unsubscribe, and an AWS signature is required. If the Unsubscribe call does not require authentication and the requester is not the subscription owner, a final cancellation message is delivered to the endpoint, so that the endpoint owner can easily resubscribe to the topic if the Unsubscribe request was unintended. This action is throttled at 100 transactions per second (TPS).

Required Parameters
{
  "SubscriptionArn": "The ARN of the subscription to be deleted."
}

    UntagResource()

Remove tags from the specified Amazon SNS topic. For an overview, see Amazon SNS Tags in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.

Required Parameters
{
  "ResourceArn": "The ARN of the topic from which to remove tags.",
  "TagKeys": "The list of tag keys to remove from the specified topic."
