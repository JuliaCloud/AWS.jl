    analyze_document(document, feature_types)
    analyze_document(document, feature_types, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.  The types of
information returned are as follows:    Form data (key-value pairs). The related
information is returned in two Block objects, each of type KEY_VALUE_SET: a KEY Block
object and a VALUE Block object. For example, Name: Ana Silva Carolina contains a key and
value. Name: is the key. Ana Silva Carolina is the value.   Table and table cell data. A
TABLE Block object contains information about a detected table. A CELL Block object is
returned for each cell in a table.   Lines and words of text. A LINE Block object contains
one or more WORD Block objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are
returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of FeatureTypes).
  Signatures. A SIGNATURE Block object contains the location information of a signature in
a document. If used in conjunction with forms or tables, a signature can be given a
Key-Value pairing or be detected in the cell of a table.   Query. A QUERY Block object
contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.
Query Result. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that
connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.   Selection
elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form
data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object contains information about a selection
element, including the selection status. You can choose which type of analysis to perform
by specifying the FeatureTypes list.  The output is returned in a list of Block objects.
AnalyzeDocument is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use
StartDocumentAnalysis. For more information, see Document Text Analysis.

# Arguments
- `document`: The input document as base64-encoded bytes or an Amazon S3 object. If you use
  the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, you can't pass image bytes. The document
  must be an image in JPEG, PNG, PDF, or TIFF format. If you're using an AWS SDK to call
  Amazon Textract, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes that are passed using the
  Bytes field.
- `feature_types`: A list of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to the list to
  return information about the tables that are detected in the input document. Add FORMS to
  return detected form data. Add SIGNATURES to return the locations of detected signatures.
  Add LAYOUT to the list to return information about the layout of the document. All lines
  and words detected in the document are included in the response (including text that isn't
  related to the value of FeatureTypes).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AdaptersConfig"`: Specifies the adapter to be used when analyzing a document.
- `"HumanLoopConfig"`: Sets the configuration for the human in the loop workflow for
  analyzing documents.
- `"QueriesConfig"`: Contains Queries and the alias for those Queries, as determined by the
  input.

Block object is the parent of LINE Block objects that represent the lines of detected text

Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that analyzes text in a
document. You start asynchronous text analysis by calling StartDocumentAnalysis, which
returns a job identifier (JobId). When the text analysis operation finishes, Amazon
Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
SNS) topic that's registered in the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis. To get the
results of the text-detection operation, first check that the status value published to the
Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetDocumentAnalysis, and pass the job identifier
(JobId) from the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis.  GetDocumentAnalysis returns an
array of Block objects. The following types of information are returned:    Form data
(key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two Block objects, each of type
KEY_VALUE_SET: a KEY Block object and a VALUE Block object. For example, Name: Ana Silva
Carolina contains a key and value. Name: is the key. Ana Silva Carolina is the value.
Table and table cell data. A TABLE Block object contains information about a detected
table. A CELL Block object is returned for each cell in a table.   Lines and words of text.
A LINE Block object contains one or more WORD Block objects. All lines and words that are
detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with
the value of the StartDocumentAnalysis FeatureTypes input parameter).    Query. A QUERY
Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block
object.   Query Results. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and
an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.
While processing a document with queries, look out for INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETERS output.
This indicates that either the per page query limit has been exceeded or that the operation
is trying to query a page in the document which doesn’t exist.   Selection elements such
as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in
tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object contains information about a selection element,
including the selection status. Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks
that are returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of
NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of
results. To get the next page of results, call GetDocumentAnalysis, and populate the
NextToken request parameter with the token value that's returned from the previous call to
GetDocumentAnalysis. For more information, see Document Text Analysis.

# Arguments
- `job_id`: A unique identifier for the text-detection job. The JobId is returned from
  StartDocumentAnalysis. A JobId value is only valid for 7 days.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that analyzes invoices and
receipts. Amazon Textract finds contact information, items purchased, and vendor name, from
input invoices and receipts. You start asynchronous invoice/receipt analysis by calling
StartExpenseAnalysis, which returns a job identifier (JobId). Upon completion of the
invoice/receipt analysis, Amazon Textract publishes the completion status to the Amazon
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. This topic must be registered in the
initial call to StartExpenseAnalysis. To get the results of the invoice/receipt analysis
operation, first ensure that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is
SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetExpenseAnalysis, and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the
initial call to StartExpenseAnalysis. Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of
blocks that are returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value
of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set
of results. To get the next page of results, call GetExpenseAnalysis, and populate the
NextToken request parameter with the token value that's returned from the previous call to
GetExpenseAnalysis. For more information, see Analyzing Invoices and Receipts.

# Arguments
- `job_id`: A unique identifier for the text detection job. The JobId is returned from
  StartExpenseAnalysis. A JobId value is only valid for 7 days.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"MaxResults"`: The maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
  value you can specify is 20. If you specify a value greater than 20, a maximum of 20
  results is returned. The default value is 20.
- `"NextToken"`: If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more blocks to
  retrieve), Amazon Textract returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this
  pagination token to retrieve the next set of blocks.

# Arguments
- `document_location`: The location of the document to be processed.
- `feature_types`: A list of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to the list to

  more than once. For more information, see Calling Amazon Textract Asynchronous Operations.
- `"JobTag"`: An identifier that you specify that's included in the completion notification
  published to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, you can use JobTag to identify the type of
