    analyze_document(document, feature_types)
    analyze_document(document, feature_types, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.  The types of
information returned are as follows:    Form data (key-value pairs). The related
information is returned in two Block objects, each of type KEY_VALUE_SET: a KEY Block
object and a VALUE Block object. For example, Name: Ana Silva Carolina contains a key and
value. Name: is the key. Ana Silva Carolina is the value.   Table and table cell data. A
TABLE Block object contains information about a detected table. A CELL Block object is
returned for each cell in a table.   Lines and words of text. A LINE Block object contains
one or more WORD Block objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are
returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of FeatureTypes).
  Queries.A QUERIES_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query, the alias
associated and an ID that connect it to the query asked. This Block also contains a
location and attached confidence score.   Selection elements such as check boxes and option
buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT
Block object contains information about a selection element, including the selection
status. You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the FeatureTypes
list.  The output is returned in a list of Block objects.  AnalyzeDocument is a synchronous
operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use StartDocumentAnalysis. For more
information, see Document Text Analysis.

# Arguments
- `document`: The input document as base64-encoded bytes or an Amazon S3 object. If you use
  the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, you can't pass image bytes. The document
  must be an image in JPEG, PNG, PDF, or TIFF format. If you're using an AWS SDK to call
  Amazon Textract, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes that are passed using the
  Bytes field.
- `feature_types`: A list of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to the list to
  return information about the tables that are detected in the input document. Add FORMS to
  return detected form data. To perform both types of analysis, add TABLES and FORMS to
  FeatureTypes. All lines and words detected in the document are included in the response
  (including text that isn't related to the value of FeatureTypes).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"HumanLoopConfig"`: Sets the configuration for the human in the loop workflow for
  analyzing documents.
- `"QueriesConfig"`: Contains Queries and the alias for those Queries, as determined by the
  input.

    get_document_analysis(job_id)
    get_document_analysis(job_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that analyzes text in a
document. You start asynchronous text analysis by calling StartDocumentAnalysis, which
returns a job identifier (JobId). When the text analysis operation finishes, Amazon
Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
SNS) topic that's registered in the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis. To get the
results of the text-detection operation, first check that the status value published to the
Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetDocumentAnalysis, and pass the job identifier
(JobId) from the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis.  GetDocumentAnalysis returns an
array of Block objects. The following types of information are returned:    Form data
(key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two Block objects, each of type
KEY_VALUE_SET: a KEY Block object and a VALUE Block object. For example, Name: Ana Silva
Carolina contains a key and value. Name: is the key. Ana Silva Carolina is the value.
Table and table cell data. A TABLE Block object contains information about a detected
table. A CELL Block object is returned for each cell in a table.   Lines and words of text.
A LINE Block object contains one or more WORD Block objects. All lines and words that are
detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with
the value of the StartDocumentAnalysis FeatureTypes input parameter).    Queries. A
QUERIES_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query, the alias associated and an
ID that connect it to the query asked. This Block also contains a location and attached
confidence score   Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio
buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object
contains information about a selection element, including the selection status. Use the
MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks that are returned. If there are more
results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response
contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of
results, call GetDocumentAnalysis, and populate the NextToken request parameter with the
token value that's returned from the previous call to GetDocumentAnalysis. For more
information, see Document Text Analysis.

# Arguments
- `job_id`: A unique identifier for the text-detection job. The JobId is returned from
  StartDocumentAnalysis. A JobId value is only valid for 7 days.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

  value that you can specify is 1,000. If you specify a value greater than 1,000, a maximum
  of 1,000 results is returned. The default value is 1,000.
- `"NextToken"`: If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more blocks to

    start_document_analysis(document_location, feature_types, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Starts the asynchronous analysis of an input document for relationships between detected
items such as key-value pairs, tables, and selection elements.  StartDocumentAnalysis can
analyze text in documents that are in JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and PDF format. The documents are
stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use DocumentLocation to specify the bucket name and file
name of the document.   StartDocumentAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId) that you use
to get the results of the operation. When text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract
publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic
that you specify in NotificationChannel. To get the results of the text analysis operation,
first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so,
call GetDocumentAnalysis, and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to
StartDocumentAnalysis. For more information, see Document Text Analysis.

# Arguments
- `document_location`: The location of the document to be processed.
- `feature_types`: A list of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to the list to
  return information about the tables that are detected in the input document. Add FORMS to
  return detected form data. To perform both types of analysis, add TABLES and FORMS to
  FeatureTypes. All lines and words detected in the document are included in the response
  (including text that isn't related to the value of FeatureTypes).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: The idempotent token that you use to identify the start request.
  If you use the same token with multiple StartDocumentAnalysis requests, the same JobId is
  returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from being accidentally started
  more than once. For more information, see Calling Amazon Textract Asynchronous Operations.
- `"JobTag"`: An identifier that you specify that's included in the completion notification
  published to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, you can use JobTag to identify the type of
  document that the completion notification corresponds to (such as a tax form or a receipt).
- `"KMSKeyId"`: The KMS key used to encrypt the inference results. This can be in either
  Key ID or Key Alias format. When a KMS key is provided, the KMS key will be used for
  server-side encryption of the objects in the customer bucket. When this parameter is not
  enabled, the result will be encrypted server side,using SSE-S3.
- `"NotificationChannel"`: The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Textract to
  publish the completion status of the operation to.
- `"OutputConfig"`: Sets if the output will go to a customer defined bucket. By default,
  Amazon Textract will save the results internally to be accessed by the GetDocumentAnalysis
  operation.
