    create_access_point(bucket, name, x-amz-account-id)
    create_access_point(bucket, name, x-amz-account-id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an access point and associates it with the specified bucket. For more information,
see Managing Data Access with Amazon S3 Access Points in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   S3 on
Outposts only supports VPC-style access points.  For more information, see  Accessing
Amazon S3 on Outposts using virtual private cloud (VPC) only access points in the Amazon S3
User Guide.  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request and an S3 on
Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request
syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and
the x-amz-outpost-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.  The
following actions are related to CreateAccessPoint:    GetAccessPoint     DeleteAccessPoint
    ListAccessPoints

# Arguments
- `bucket`: The name of the bucket that you want to associate this access point with. For
  using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the
  name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well. For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with
  the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the
  format
  arn:aws:s3-outposts:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:outpost/&lt;outpost-id&gt;/bucket/&lt
  ;my-bucket-name&gt;. For example, to access the bucket reports through outpost my-outpost
  owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of
  arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports. The value
  must be URL encoded.
- `name`: The name you want to assign to this access point.
- `x-amz-account-id`: The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the bucket for
  which you want to create an access point.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"PublicAccessBlockConfiguration"`:  The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to
  apply to the access point.
- `"VpcConfiguration"`: If you include this field, Amazon S3 restricts access to this
  access point to requests from the specified virtual private cloud (VPC).  This is required
  for creating an access point for Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

 This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket policy. To delete an S3 bucket policy,
see DeleteBucketPolicy in the Amazon S3 API Reference.   This implementation of the DELETE
action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on
Outposts bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web
Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the
s3-outposts:DeleteBucketPolicy permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to
the bucket owner's account to use this action. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on
Outposts in Amazon S3 User Guide. If you don't have DeleteBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon
S3 returns a 403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not
using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a 405
Method Not Allowed error.   As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web
Services account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy
explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.  For more information
about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies and User Policies.  All Amazon S3 on

  the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the
  format
  arn:aws:s3-outposts:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:outpost/&lt;outpost-id&gt;/bucket/&lt
  ;my-bucket-name&gt;. For example, to access the bucket reports through outpost my-outpost
  owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of
  arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports. The value
  must be URL encoded.
- `"maxResults"`: The maximum number of access points that you want to include in the list.
  If the specified bucket has more than this number of access points, then the response will
  include a continuation token in the NextToken field that you can use to retrieve the next
  page of access points.
- `"nextToken"`: A continuation token. If a previous call to ListAccessPoints returned a
  continuation token in the NextToken field, then providing that value here causes Amazon S3
  to retrieve the next page of results.

resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a
specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost
of that application across several services. For more information, see Cost allocation and

Sets the supplied tag-set on an S3 Batch Operations job. A tag is a key-value pair. You can
associate S3 Batch Operations tags with any job by sending a PUT request against the
tagging subresource that is associated with the job. To modify the existing tag set, you
can either replace the existing tag set entirely, or make changes within the existing tag
set by retrieving the existing tag set using GetJobTagging, modify that tag set, and use
this action to replace the tag set with the one you modified. For more information, see
Controlling access and labeling jobs using tags in the Amazon S3 User Guide.      If you
send this request with an empty tag set, Amazon S3 deletes the existing tag set on the
Batch Operations job. If you use this method, you are charged for a Tier 1 Request (PUT).
For more information, see Amazon S3 pricing.   For deleting existing tags for your Batch
Operations job, a DeleteJobTagging request is preferred because it achieves the same result
without incurring charges.   A few things to consider about using tags:   Amazon S3 limits
the maximum number of tags to 50 tags per job.   You can associate up to 50 tags with a job
as long as they have unique tag keys.   A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters in
length, and tag values can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length.   The key and values
are case sensitive.   For tagging-related restrictions related to characters and encodings,
