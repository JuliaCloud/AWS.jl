    CancelTaskExecution()

Cancels execution of a task.  When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files are abruptly interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, AWS DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task execution.

Required Parameters
TaskExecutionArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution to cancel.

"""
    CreateAgent()

Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information such as the AWS Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the AWS Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this AWS Region. You can activate the agent in a VPC (Virtual private Cloud) or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public Internet. You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run.  Agents are automatically updated by AWS on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks. 

Required Parameters
ActivationKey => Your agent activation key. You can get the activation key either by sending an HTTP GET request with redirects that enable you to get the agent IP address (port 80). Alternatively, you can get it from the AWS DataSync console. The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your agent in the query string parameter activationKey. It might also include other activation-related parameters; however, these are merely defaults. The arguments you pass to this API call determine the actual configuration of your agent. For more information, see Activating an Agent in the AWS DataSync User Guide. 

Optional Parameters
AgentName => The name you configured for your agent. This value is a text reference that is used to identify the agent in the console.
SecurityGroupArns => The ARNs of the security groups used to protect your data transfer task subnets. See CreateAgentRequest SubnetArns.
SubnetArns => The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets in which DataSync will create elastic network interfaces for each data transfer task. The agent that runs a task must be private. When you start a task that is associated with an agent created in a VPC, or one that has access to an IP address in a VPC, then the task is also private. In this case, DataSync creates four network interfaces for each task in your subnet. For a data transfer to work, the agent must be able to route to all these four network interfaces.
Tags => The key-value pair that represents the tag that you want to associate with the agent. The value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search for your agents.  Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.  
VpcEndpointId => The ID of the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) endpoint that the agent has access to. This is the client-side VPC endpoint, also called a PrivateLink. If you don't have a PrivateLink VPC endpoint, see Creating a VPC Endpoint Service Configuration in the AWS VPC User Guide. VPC endpoint ID looks like this: vpce-01234d5aff67890e1.

"""
    CreateLocationEfs()

Creates an endpoint for an Amazon EFS file system.

Required Parameters
Ec2Config => The subnet and security group that the Amazon EFS file system uses. The security group that you provide needs to be able to communicate with the security group on the mount target in the subnet specified. The exact relationship between security group M (of the mount target) and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use at this stage) is as follows:     Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must allow inbound access for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on the NFS port (2049) from security group S. You can enable inbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.    Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have a rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of the file system’s mount targets. You can enable outbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group. For information about security groups and mount targets, see Security Groups for Amazon EC2 Instances and Mount Targets in the Amazon EFS User Guide.   
EfsFilesystemArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon EFS file system.

Optional Parameters
Subdirectory => A subdirectory in the location’s path. This subdirectory in the EFS file system is used to read data from the EFS source location or write data to the EFS destination. By default, AWS DataSync uses the root directory.   Subdirectory must be specified with forward slashes. For example /path/to/folder. 
Tags => The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the resource. The value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you create a name tag for your location.

    CreateLocationNfs()

Defines a file system on a Network File System (NFS) server that can be read from or written to

Required Parameters
OnPremConfig => Contains a list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents that are used to connect to an NFS server.
ServerHostname => The name of the NFS server. This value is the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the NFS server. An agent that is installed on-premises uses this host name to mount the NFS server in a network.   This name must either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP version 4 (IPv4) address. 
Subdirectory => The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used to read data from the NFS source location or write data to the NFS destination. The NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other NFS clients in your network.  To see all the paths exported by your NFS server. run "showmount -e nfs-server-name" from an NFS client that has access to your server. You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is accessible without Kerberos authentication.  To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have permissions to read all the data. To ensure this, either configure the NFS export with no_root_squash, or ensure that the permissions for all of the files that you want DataSync allow read access for all users. Doing either enables the agent to read the files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access. For information about NFS export configuration, see 18.7. The /etc/exports Configuration File in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

Optional Parameters
MountOptions => The NFS mount options that DataSync can use to mount your NFS share.

    CreateLocationS3()

Creates an endpoint for an Amazon S3 bucket. For AWS DataSync to access a destination S3 bucket, it needs an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has the required permissions. You can set up the required permissions by creating an IAM policy that grants the required permissions and attaching the policy to the role. An example of such a policy is shown in the examples section. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/working-with-locations.html#create-s3-location in the AWS DataSync User Guide. 

Required Parameters
S3BucketArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon S3 bucket.
S3Config => 

Optional Parameters
S3StorageClass => The Amazon S3 storage class that you want to store your files in when this location is used as a task destination.

    CreateLocationSmb()

Defines a file system on an Server Message Block (SMB) server that can be read from or written to.

Required Parameters
AgentArns => The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple Message Block (SMB) location. 
Password => The password of the user who can mount the share, has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.
ServerHostname => The name of the SMB server. This value is the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the SMB server. An agent that is installed on-premises uses this hostname to mount the SMB server in a network.  This name must either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP version 4 (IPv4) address. 
Subdirectory => The subdirectory in the SMB file system that is used to read data from the SMB source location or write data to the SMB destination. The SMB path should be a path that's exported by the SMB server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other SMB clients in your network.   Subdirectory must be specified with forward slashes. For example /path/to/folder.  To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have permissions to mount the SMB share, as well as to access all the data in that share. To ensure this, either ensure that the user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share, and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access, or use credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount the share. Doing either enables the agent to access the data. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.
User => The user who can mount the share, has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.

Optional Parameters
Domain => The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.
MountOptions => The mount options used by DataSync to access the SMB server.

"""
    CreateTask()

Creates a task. A task is a set of two locations (source and destination) and a set of Options that you use to control the behavior of a task. If you don't specify Options when you create a task, AWS DataSync populates them with service defaults. When you create a task, it first enters the CREATING state. During CREATING AWS DataSync attempts to mount the on-premises Network File System (NFS) location. The task transitions to the AVAILABLE state without waiting for the AWS location to become mounted. If required, AWS DataSync mounts the AWS location before each task execution. If an agent that is associated with a source (NFS) location goes offline, the task transitions to the UNAVAILABLE status. If the status of the task remains in the CREATING status for more than a few minutes, it means that your agent might be having trouble mounting the source NFS file system. Check the task's ErrorCode and ErrorDetail. Mount issues are often caused by either a misconfigured firewall or a mistyped NFS server host name.

Required Parameters
DestinationLocationArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS storage resource's location. 
SourceLocationArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source location for the task.

Optional Parameters
CloudWatchLogGroupArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon CloudWatch log group that is used to monitor and log events in the task.  For more information on these groups, see Working with Log Groups and Log Streams in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.  For more information about how to use CloudWatch Logs with DataSync, see Monitoring Your Task in the AWS DataSync User Guide. 
Excludes => A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example, "/folder1|/folder2"   
Name => The name of a task. This value is a text reference that is used to identify the task in the console. 
Options => The set of configuration options that control the behavior of a single execution of the task that occurs when you call StartTaskExecution. You can configure these options to preserve metadata such as user ID (UID) and group ID (GID), file permissions, data integrity verification, and so on. For each individual task execution, you can override these options by specifying the OverrideOptions before starting a the task execution. For more information, see the operation. 
Schedule => Specifies a schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a destination location. The schedule should be specified in UTC time. For more information, see task-scheduling.
