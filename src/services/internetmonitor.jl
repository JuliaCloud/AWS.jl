    create_monitor(monitor_name)
    create_monitor(monitor_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a monitor in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. A monitor is built based on
information from the application resources that you add: VPCs, Network Load Balancers
(NLBs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon WorkSpaces directories. Internet
Monitor then publishes internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to
the city-networks. That is, the locations and ASNs (typically internet service providers or
ISPs), where clients access your application. For more information, see Using Amazon
CloudWatch Internet Monitor in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. When you create a monitor,
you choose the percentage of traffic that you want to monitor. You can also set a maximum
limit for the number of city-networks where client traffic is monitored, that caps the
total traffic that Internet Monitor monitors. A city-network maximum is the limit of
city-networks, but you only pay for the number of city-networks that are actually
monitored. You can update your monitor at any time to change the percentage of traffic to
monitor or the city-networks maximum. For more information, see Choosing a city-network
maximum value in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

# Arguments
- `monitor_name`: The name of the monitor.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientToken"`: A unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters that you
  specify to make an idempotent API request. Don't reuse the same client token for other API
  requests.
- `"HealthEventsConfig"`: Defines the threshold percentages and other configuration
  information for when Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor creates a health event. Internet
  Monitor creates a health event when an internet issue that affects your application end
  users has a health score percentage that is at or below a specific threshold, and,
  sometimes, when other criteria are met. If you don't set a health event threshold, the
  default value is 95%. For more information, see  Change health event thresholds in the
  Internet Monitor section of the CloudWatch User Guide.
- `"InternetMeasurementsLogDelivery"`: Publish internet measurements for Internet Monitor
  to an Amazon S3 bucket in addition to CloudWatch Logs.
- `"MaxCityNetworksToMonitor"`: The maximum number of city-networks to monitor for your
  resources. A city-network is the location (city) where clients access your application
  resources from and the ASN or network provider, such as an internet service provider (ISP),
  that clients access the resources through. Setting this limit can help control billing
  costs. To learn more, see Choosing a city-network maximum value  in the Amazon CloudWatch
  Internet Monitor section of the CloudWatch User Guide.
- `"Resources"`: The resources to include in a monitor, which you provide as a set of
  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). Resources can be VPCs, NLBs, Amazon CloudFront distributions,
  or Amazon WorkSpaces directories. You can add a combination of VPCs and CloudFront
  distributions, or you can add WorkSpaces directories, or you can add NLBs. You can't add
  NLBs or WorkSpaces directories together with any other resources.  If you add only Amazon
  VPC resources, at least one VPC must have an Internet Gateway attached to it, to make sure
  that it has internet connectivity.
- `"Tags"`: The tags for a monitor. You can add a maximum of 50 tags in Internet Monitor.
- `"TrafficPercentageToMonitor"`: The percentage of the internet-facing traffic for your
  application that you want to monitor with this monitor. If you set a city-networks maximum,
  that limit overrides the traffic percentage that you set. To learn more, see Choosing an
  application traffic percentage to monitor  in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor
  section of the CloudWatch User Guide.

Adds a tag to a resource. Tags are supported only for monitors in Amazon CloudWatch
Internet Monitor. You can add a maximum of 50 tags in Internet Monitor. A minimum of one
tag is required for this call. It returns an error if you use the TagResource request with
0 tags.

# Arguments
- `resource_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a tag that you add to a resource. Tags
  are supported only for monitors in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor.
- `tags`: Tags that you add to a resource. You can add a maximum of 50 tags in Internet
  Monitor.

    update_monitor(monitor_name)
    update_monitor(monitor_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates a monitor. You can update a monitor to change the percentage of traffic to monitor
or the maximum number of city-networks (locations and ASNs), to add or remove resources, or
to change the status of the monitor. Note that you can't change the name of a monitor. The
city-network maximum that you choose is the limit, but you only pay for the number of
city-networks that are actually monitored. For more information, see Choosing a
city-network maximum value in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

# Arguments
- `monitor_name`: The name of the monitor.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientToken"`: A unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters that you
  specify to make an idempotent API request. You should not reuse the same client token for
  other API requests.
- `"HealthEventsConfig"`: The list of health score thresholds. A threshold percentage for
  health scores, along with other configuration information, determines when Internet Monitor
  creates a health event when there's an internet issue that affects your application end
  users. For more information, see  Change health event thresholds in the Internet Monitor
  section of the CloudWatch User Guide.
- `"InternetMeasurementsLogDelivery"`: Publish internet measurements for Internet Monitor
  to another location, such as an Amazon S3 bucket. The measurements are also published to
  Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
- `"MaxCityNetworksToMonitor"`: The maximum number of city-networks to monitor for your
  application. A city-network is the location (city) where clients access your application
  resources from and the ASN or network provider, such as an internet service provider (ISP),
  that clients access the resources through. Setting this limit can help control billing
  costs.
- `"ResourcesToAdd"`: The resources to include in a monitor, which you provide as a set of
  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). Resources can be VPCs, NLBs, Amazon CloudFront distributions,
  or Amazon WorkSpaces directories. You can add a combination of VPCs and CloudFront
  distributions, or you can add WorkSpaces directories, or you can add NLBs. You can't add
  NLBs or WorkSpaces directories together with any other resources.  If you add only Amazon
  Virtual Private Clouds resources, at least one VPC must have an Internet Gateway attached
  to it, to make sure that it has internet connectivity.
- `"ResourcesToRemove"`: The resources to remove from a monitor, which you provide as a set
  of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
- `"Status"`: The status for a monitor. The accepted values for Status with the
  UpdateMonitor API call are the following: ACTIVE and INACTIVE. The following values are not
  accepted: PENDING, and ERROR.
- `"TrafficPercentageToMonitor"`: The percentage of the internet-facing traffic for your
  application that you want to monitor with this monitor. If you set a city-networks maximum,
  that limit overrides the traffic percentage that you set. To learn more, see Choosing an
  application traffic percentage to monitor  in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor
  section of the CloudWatch User Guide.
