    BatchPutAssetPropertyValue()

Sends a list of asset property values to AWS IoT SiteWise. Each value is a timestamp-quality-value (TQV) data point. For more information, see Ingesting Data Using the API in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide. To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:   The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.   A propertyAlias, which is a data stream alias (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature). To define an asset property's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty.    With respect to Unix epoch time, AWS IoT SiteWise accepts only TQVs that have a timestamp of no more than 15 minutes in the past and no more than 5 minutes in the future. AWS IoT SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the inclusive range of [-15, +5] minutes and returns a TimestampOutOfRangeException error. For each asset property, AWS IoT SiteWise overwrites TQVs with duplicate timestamps unless the newer TQV has a different quality. For example, if you store a TQV {T1, GOOD, V1}, then storing {T1, GOOD, V2} replaces the existing TQV. 

Required Parameters

    UpdateAsset()

Updates an asset's name. For more information, see Updating Assets and Models in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide.

Required Parameters
{
  "assetId": "The ID of the asset to update.",
  "assetName": "A unique, friendly name for the asset."

    UpdateAssetModel()

Updates an asset model and all of the assets that were created from the model. Each asset created from the model inherits the updated asset model's property and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see Updating Assets and Models in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide.  This operation overwrites the existing model with the provided model. To avoid deleting your asset model's properties or hierarchies, you must include their IDs and definitions in the updated asset model payload. For more information, see DescribeAssetModel. If you remove a property from an asset model or update a property's formula expression, AWS IoT SiteWise deletes all previous data for that property. If you remove a hierarchy definition from an asset model, AWS IoT SiteWise disassociates every asset associated with that hierarchy. You can't change the type or data type of an existing property. 

Required Parameters
{
  "assetModelId": "The ID of the asset model to update.",
  "assetModelName": "A unique, friendly name for the asset model."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "assetModelDescription": "A description for the asset model.",
  "assetModelHierarchies": "The updated hierarchy definitions of the asset model. Each hierarchy specifies an asset model whose assets can be children of any other assets created from this asset model. For more information, see Asset Hierarchies in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide. You can specify up to 10 hierarchies per asset model. For more information, see Quotas in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide.",
  "assetModelProperties": "The updated property definitions of the asset model. For more information, see Asset Properties in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide. You can specify up to 200 properties per asset model. For more information, see Quotas in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide.",
  "clientToken": "A unique case-sensitive identifier that you can provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Don't reuse this client token if a new idempotent request is required."

"""
    UpdateAssetProperty()

Updates an asset property's alias and notification state.  This operation overwrites the property's existing alias and notification state. To keep your existing property's alias or notification state, you must include the existing values in the UpdateAssetProperty request. For more information, see DescribeAssetProperty. 

Required Parameters
{
  "assetId": "The ID of the asset to be updated.",

For more information, see Mapping Industrial Data Streams to Asset Properties in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide. If you omit this parameter, the alias is removed from the property.",
  "propertyNotificationState": "The MQTT notification state (enabled or disabled) for this asset property. When the notification state is enabled, AWS IoT SiteWise publishes property value updates to a unique MQTT topic. For more information, see Interacting with Other Services in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide. If you omit this parameter, the notification state is set to DISABLED."
