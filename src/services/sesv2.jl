    CreateConfigurationSet()

Create a configuration set. Configuration sets are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails that you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by specifying the name of the configuration set when you call the Amazon SES API v2. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email. 

Required Parameters
{
  "ConfigurationSetName": "The name of the configuration set."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "DeliveryOptions": "An object that defines the dedicated IP pool that is used to send emails that you send using the configuration set.",
  "ReputationOptions": "An object that defines whether or not Amazon SES collects reputation metrics for the emails that you send that use the configuration set.",
  "SendingOptions": "An object that defines whether or not Amazon SES can send email that you send using the configuration set.",
  "SuppressionOptions": "",
  "Tags": "An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that you want to associate with the configuration set.",

"""
    CreateConfigurationSetEventDestination()

Create an event destination. Events include message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage. A single configuration set can include more than one event destination.

Required Parameters
{
  "ConfigurationSetName": "The name of the configuration set that you want to add an event destination to.",
  "EventDestination": "An object that defines the event destination.",
  "EventDestinationName": "A name that identifies the event destination within the configuration set."

    CreateDedicatedIpPool()

Create a new pool of dedicated IP addresses. A pool can include one or more dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your AWS account. You can associate a pool with a configuration set. When you send an email that uses that configuration set, the message is sent from one of the addresses in the associated pool.

Required Parameters
{
  "PoolName": "The name of the dedicated IP pool."

Optional Parameters
{
  "Tags": "An object that defines the tags (keys and values) that you want to associate with the pool."
}

"""
    CreateDeliverabilityTestReport()

Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon SES then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport operation to view the results of the test.

Required Parameters
{
  "Content": "The HTML body of the message that you sent when you performed the predictive inbox placement test.",
  "FromEmailAddress": "The email address that the predictive inbox placement test email was sent from."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "ReportName": "A unique name that helps you to identify the predictive inbox placement test when you retrieve the results.",

}
"""

"""
    CreateEmailIdentity()

Starts the process of verifying an email identity. An identity is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity. When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.  When you verify a domain without specifying the DkimSigningAttributes object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as Easy DKIM. Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the CreateEmailIdentity operation has to include the DkimSigningAttributes object. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key that you want to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.

Required Parameters
{
  "EmailIdentity": "The email address or domain that you want to verify."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "DkimSigningAttributes": "If your request includes this object, Amazon SES configures the identity to use Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM) for DKIM authentication purposes, as opposed to the default method, Easy DKIM. You can only specify this object if the email identity is a domain, as opposed to an address.",

    SendEmail()

Sends an email message. You can use the Amazon SES API v2 to send two types of messages:    Simple – A standard email message.

The message that you specify has to be a valid MIME message.

    TagResource()

Add one or more tags (keys and values) to a specified resource. A tag is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key.

Required Parameters
{
  "ResourceArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to add one or more tags to.",
  "Tags": "A list of the tags that you want to add to the resource. A tag consists of a required tag key (Key) and an associated tag value (Value). The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters."
