    delete_recommendation_preferences(recommendation_preference_names, resource_type; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Deletes a recommendation preference, such as enhanced infrastructure metrics. For more
information, see Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User
Guide.

# Arguments
- `recommendation_preference_names`: The name of the recommendation preference to delete.
  Enhanced infrastructure metrics (EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics) is the only feature that
  can be activated through preferences. Therefore, it is also the only recommendation
  preference that can be deleted.
- `resource_type`: The target resource type of the recommendation preference to delete. The
  Ec2Instance option encompasses standalone instances and instances that are part of Auto
  Scaling groups. The AutoScalingGroup option encompasses only instances that are part of an
  Auto Scaling group.

# Keyword Parameters
- `scope`: An object that describes the scope of the recommendation preference to delete.
  You can delete recommendation preferences that are created at the organization level (for
  management accounts of an organization only), account level, and resource level. For more
  information, see Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User
  Guide.
