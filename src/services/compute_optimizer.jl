    DescribeRecommendationExportJobs()

Describes recommendation export jobs created in the last seven days. Use the ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations or ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations actions to request an export of your recommendations. Then use the DescribeRecommendationExportJobs action to view your export jobs.

# Optional Parameters
- `filters`: An array of objects that describe a filter to return a more specific list of export jobs.
- `jobIds`: The identification numbers of the export jobs to return. An export job ID is returned when you create an export using the ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations or ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations actions. All export jobs created in the last seven days are returned if this parameter is omitted.
- `maxResults`: The maximum number of export jobs to return with a single request. To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the returned NextToken value.
- `nextToken`: The token to advance to the next page of export jobs.

    ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations()

Exports optimization recommendations for Auto Scaling groups. Recommendations are exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the Compute Optimizer User Guide. You can have only one Auto Scaling group export job in progress per AWS Region.

# Required Parameters
- `s3DestinationConfig`: An object to specify the destination Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket name and key prefix for the export job. You must create the destination Amazon S3 bucket for your recommendations export before you create the export job. Compute Optimizer does not create the S3 bucket for you. After you create the S3 bucket, ensure that it has the required permission policy to allow Compute Optimizer to write the export file to it. If you plan to specify an object prefix when you create the export job, you must include the object prefix in the policy that you add to the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy for Compute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer user guide.

# Optional Parameters
- `accountIds`: The IDs of the AWS accounts for which to export Auto Scaling group recommendations. If your account is the management account of an organization, use this parameter to specify the member accounts for which you want to export recommendations. This parameter cannot be specified together with the include member accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive. Recommendations for member accounts are not included in the export if this parameter, or the include member accounts parameter, is omitted. You can specify multiple account IDs per request.
- `fieldsToExport`: The recommendations data to include in the export file. For more information about the fields that can be exported, see Exported files in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.
- `fileFormat`: The format of the export file. The only export file format currently supported is Csv.
- `filters`: An array of objects that describe a filter to export a more specific set of Auto Scaling group recommendations.
- `includeMemberAccounts`: Indicates whether to include recommendations for resources in all member accounts of the organization if your account is the management account of an organization. The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer. Recommendations for member accounts of the organization are not included in the export file if this parameter is omitted. This parameter cannot be specified together with the account IDs parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive. Recommendations for member accounts are not included in the export if this parameter, or the account IDs parameter, is omitted.
