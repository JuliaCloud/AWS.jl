Describes recommendation export jobs created in the last seven days. Use the
ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations or ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations actions to
request an export of your recommendations. Then use the DescribeRecommendationExportJobs
action to view your export jobs.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"filters"`: An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific list of
  export jobs.
- `"jobIds"`: The identification numbers of the export jobs to return. An export job ID is
  returned when you create an export using the ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations or
  ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations actions. All export jobs created in the last seven days
  are returned if this parameter is omitted.
- `"maxResults"`: The maximum number of export jobs to return with a single request. To
  retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the returned nextToken value.
- `"nextToken"`: The token to advance to the next page of export jobs.

    export_auto_scaling_group_recommendations(s3_destination_config)
    export_auto_scaling_group_recommendations(s3_destination_config, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Exports optimization recommendations for Auto Scaling groups. Recommendations are exported
in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that
you specify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the Compute Optimizer
User Guide. You can have only one Auto Scaling group export job in progress per Amazon Web
Services Region.

# Arguments
- `s3_destination_config`: An object to specify the destination Amazon Simple Storage
  Service (Amazon S3) bucket name and key prefix for the export job. You must create the
  destination Amazon S3 bucket for your recommendations export before you create the export
  job. Compute Optimizer does not create the S3 bucket for you. After you create the S3
  bucket, ensure that it has the required permissions policy to allow Compute Optimizer to
  write the export file to it. If you plan to specify an object prefix when you create the
  export job, you must include the object prefix in the policy that you add to the S3 bucket.
  For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy for Compute Optimizer in the Compute
  Optimizer User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"accountIds"`: The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts for which to export Auto
  Scaling group recommendations. If your account is the management account of an
  organization, use this parameter to specify the member account for which you want to export
  recommendations. This parameter cannot be specified together with the include member
  accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive. Recommendations for member
  accounts are not included in the export if this parameter, or the include member accounts
  parameter, is omitted. You can specify multiple account IDs per request.
- `"fieldsToExport"`: The recommendations data to include in the export file. For more
  information about the fields that can be exported, see Exported files in the Compute
  Optimizer User Guide.
- `"fileFormat"`: The format of the export file. The only export file format currently
  supported is Csv.
- `"filters"`: An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific set of
  Auto Scaling group recommendations.
- `"includeMemberAccounts"`: Indicates whether to include recommendations for resources in
  all member accounts of the organization if your account is the management account of an
  organization. The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer, and trusted
  access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the organization account. For more
  information, see Compute Optimizer and Amazon Web Services Organizations trusted access in

    get_lambda_function_recommendations()
    get_lambda_function_recommendations(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Returns Lambda function recommendations. Compute Optimizer generates recommendations for
functions that meet a specific set of requirements. For more information, see the Supported
resources and requirements in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"accountIds"`: The ID of the Amazon Web Services account for which to return function
  recommendations. If your account is the management account of an organization, use this
  parameter to specify the member account for which you want to return function
  recommendations. Only one account ID can be specified per request.
- `"filters"`: An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific list of
  function recommendations.
- `"functionArns"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the functions for which to return
  recommendations. You can specify a qualified or unqualified ARN. If you specify an
  unqualified ARN without a function version suffix, Compute Optimizer will return
  recommendations for the latest (LATEST) version of the function. If you specify a qualified
  ARN with a version suffix, Compute Optimizer will return recommendations for the specified
  function version. For more information about using function versions, see Using versions in
  the Lambda Developer Guide.
- `"maxResults"`: The maximum number of function recommendations to return with a single
  request. To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the returned
  nextToken value.
- `"nextToken"`: The token to advance to the next page of function recommendations.

Scaling groups in an account that are NotOptimized, or Optimized.   Amazon EBS volumes in
an account that are NotOptimized, or Optimized.   Lambda functions in an account that are
NotOptimized, or Optimized.

    update_enrollment_status(status)
    update_enrollment_status(status, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates the enrollment (opt in and opt out) status of an account to the Compute Optimizer
service. If the account is a management account of an organization, this action can also be
used to enroll member accounts of the organization. You must have the appropriate
permissions to opt in to Compute Optimizer, to view its recommendations, and to opt out.
For more information, see Controlling access with Amazon Web Services Identity and Access
Management in the Compute Optimizer User Guide. When you opt in, Compute Optimizer
automatically creates a service-linked role in your account to access its data. For more
information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Compute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer
User Guide.

# Arguments
- `status`: The new enrollment status of the account. The following status options are
  available:    Active - Opts in your account to the Compute Optimizer service. Compute
  Optimizer begins analyzing the configuration and utilization metrics of your Amazon Web
  Services resources after you opt in. For more information, see Metrics analyzed by Compute
  Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.    Inactive - Opts out your account from the
  Compute Optimizer service. Your account's recommendations and related metrics data will be
  deleted from Compute Optimizer after you opt out.    The Pending and Failed options cannot
  be used to update the enrollment status of an account. They are returned in the response of
  a request to update the enrollment status of an account.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"includeMemberAccounts"`: Indicates whether to enroll member accounts of the
  organization if the account is the management account of an organization.
