    delete_recommendation_preferences(recommendation_preference_names, resource_type)
    delete_recommendation_preferences(recommendation_preference_names, resource_type, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deletes a recommendation preference, such as enhanced infrastructure metrics. For more
information, see Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User
Guide.

# Arguments
- `recommendation_preference_names`: The name of the recommendation preference to delete.
  Enhanced infrastructure metrics (EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics) is the only feature that
  can be activated through preferences. Therefore, it is also the only recommendation
  preference that can be deleted.
- `resource_type`: The target resource type of the recommendation preference to delete. The
  Ec2Instance option encompasses standalone instances and instances that are part of Auto
  Scaling groups. The AutoScalingGroup option encompasses only instances that are part of an
  Auto Scaling group.  The valid values for this parameter are Ec2Instance and
  AutoScalingGroup.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"scope"`: An object that describes the scope of the recommendation preference to delete.
  You can delete recommendation preferences that are created at the organization level (for
  management accounts of an organization only), account level, and resource level. For more
  information, see Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User
  Guide.

    export_auto_scaling_group_recommendations(s3_destination_config)
    export_auto_scaling_group_recommendations(s3_destination_config, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Exports optimization recommendations for Auto Scaling groups. Recommendations are exported
in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that
you specify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the Compute Optimizer
User Guide. You can have only one Auto Scaling group export job in progress per Amazon Web
Services Region.

# Arguments
- `s3_destination_config`: An object to specify the destination Amazon Simple Storage
  Service (Amazon S3) bucket name and key prefix for the export job. You must create the
  destination Amazon S3 bucket for your recommendations export before you create the export
  job. Compute Optimizer does not create the S3 bucket for you. After you create the S3
  bucket, ensure that it has the required permissions policy to allow Compute Optimizer to
  write the export file to it. If you plan to specify an object prefix when you create the
  export job, you must include the object prefix in the policy that you add to the S3 bucket.
  For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy for Compute Optimizer in the Compute
  Optimizer User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

  Scaling group recommendations. If your account is the management account of an
  organization, use this parameter to specify the member account for which you want to export
  recommendations. This parameter cannot be specified together with the include member
  accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive. Recommendations for member
  accounts are not included in the export if this parameter, or the include member accounts
  parameter, is omitted. You can specify multiple account IDs per request.
- `"fieldsToExport"`: The recommendations data to include in the export file. For more
  information about the fields that can be exported, see Exported files in the Compute
  Optimizer User Guide.
- `"fileFormat"`: The format of the export file. The only export file format currently
  supported is Csv.
- `"filters"`: An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific set of
  Auto Scaling group recommendations.
- `"includeMemberAccounts"`: Indicates whether to include recommendations for resources in
  all member accounts of the organization if your account is the management account of an
  organization. The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer, and trusted
  access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the organization account. For more
  information, see Compute Optimizer and Amazon Web Services Organizations trusted access in

Creates a new recommendation preference or updates an existing recommendation preference,

infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.

# Arguments
- `resource_type`: The target resource type of the recommendation preference to create. The
  Ec2Instance option encompasses standalone instances and instances that are part of Auto
  Scaling groups. The AutoScalingGroup option encompasses only instances that are part of an
  Auto Scaling group.  The valid values for this parameter are Ec2Instance and

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"enhancedInfrastructureMetrics"`: The status of the enhanced infrastructure metrics
  recommendation preference to create or update. Specify the Active status to activate the
  preference, or specify Inactive to deactivate the preference. For more information, see
  Enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.
- `"inferredWorkloadTypes"`: The status of the inferred workload types recommendation
  preference to create or update.  The inferred workload type feature is active by default.
  To deactivate it, create a recommendation preference.  Specify the Inactive status to
  deactivate the feature, or specify Active to activate it. For more information, see
  Inferred workload types in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.
- `"scope"`: An object that describes the scope of the recommendation preference to create.
  You can create recommendation preferences at the organization level (for management
  accounts of an organization only), account level, and resource level. For more information,
  see Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.  You
  cannot create recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling groups at the organization and
  account levels. You can create recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling groups only at
  the resource level by specifying a scope name of ResourceArn and a scope value of the Auto
  Scaling group Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This will configure the preference for all
  instances that are part of the specified Auto Scaling group. You also cannot create
  recommendation preferences at the resource level for instances that are part of an Auto
  Scaling group. You can create recommendation preferences at the resource level only for
  standalone instances.

Updates the enrollment (opt in and opt out) status of an account to the Compute Optimizer
service. If the account is a management account of an organization, this action can also be
used to enroll member accounts of the organization. You must have the appropriate
permissions to opt in to Compute Optimizer, to view its recommendations, and to opt out.
For more information, see Controlling access with Amazon Web Services Identity and Access
Management in the Compute Optimizer User Guide. When you opt in, Compute Optimizer
automatically creates a service-linked role in your account to access its data. For more
information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Compute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer
User Guide.

# Arguments
- `status`: The new enrollment status of the account. The following status options are
  available:    Active - Opts in your account to the Compute Optimizer service. Compute
  Optimizer begins analyzing the configuration and utilization metrics of your Amazon Web
  Services resources after you opt in. For more information, see Metrics analyzed by Compute
  Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.    Inactive - Opts out your account from the
  Compute Optimizer service. Your account's recommendations and related metrics data will be
  deleted from Compute Optimizer after you opt out.    The Pending and Failed options cannot
  be used to update the enrollment status of an account. They are returned in the response of
  a request to update the enrollment status of an account.
