    AddClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider()

Adds a new client ID (also known as audience) to the list of client IDs already registered for the specified IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource. This operation is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you add an existing client ID to the provider.

# Required Parameters
- `ClientID`: The client ID (also known as audience) to add to the IAM OpenID Connect provider resource.
- `OpenIDConnectProviderArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource to add the client ID to. You can get a list of OIDC provider ARNs by using the ListOpenIDConnectProviders operation.

    AddRoleToInstanceProfile()

Adds the specified IAM role to the specified instance profile. An instance profile can contain only one role. (The number and size of IAM resources in an AWS account are limited. For more information, see IAM and STS Quotas in the IAM User Guide.) You can remove the existing role and then add a different role to an instance profile. You must then wait for the change to appear across all of AWS because of eventual consistency. To force the change, you must disassociate the instance profile and then associate the instance profile, or you can stop your instance and then restart it.  The caller of this API must be granted the PassRole permission on the IAM role by a permissions policy.  For more information about roles, go to Working with Roles. For more information about instance profiles, go to About Instance Profiles.

    CreateAccessKey()

 Creates a new AWS secret access key and corresponding AWS access key ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is Active. If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the AWS access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the AWS account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage AWS account root user credentials. This is true even if the AWS account has no associated users. The number and size of IAM resources in an AWS account are limited. For more information, see IAM and STS Quotas in the IAM User Guide.  To ensure the security of your AWS account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys.

"""
    CreateOpenIDConnectProvider()

Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC). The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between AWS and the OIDC provider. When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:   The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust   A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications that are allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider   A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP uses   You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to use to access AWS.  The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the CreateOpenIDConnectProvider operation to highly privileged users. 

# Required Parameters
- `ThumbprintList`: A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider's server certificates. Typically this list includes only one entry. However, IAM lets you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates. The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string. You must provide at least one thumbprint when creating an IAM OIDC provider. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com. For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider's thumbprint, see Obtaining the Thumbprint for an OpenID Connect Provider in the IAM User Guide.
- `Url`: The URL of the identity provider. The URL must begin with https:// and should correspond to the iss claim in the provider's OpenID Connect ID tokens. Per the OIDC standard, path components are allowed but query parameters are not. Typically the URL consists of only a hostname, like https://server.example.org or https://example.com. You cannot register the same provider multiple times in a single AWS account. If you try to submit a URL that has already been used for an OpenID Connect provider in the AWS account, you will get an error.

# Optional Parameters
- `ClientIDList`: A list of client IDs (also known as audiences). When a mobile or web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value that identifies the application. (This is the value that's sent as the client_id parameter on OAuth requests.) You can register multiple client IDs with the same provider. For example, you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC provider. You cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single IAM OIDC provider. There is no defined format for a client ID. The CreateOpenIDConnectProviderRequest operation accepts client IDs up to 255 characters long.

Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific AWS service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your AWS resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles in the IAM User Guide.  To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the AWS service that depends on this role.

# Required Parameters
- `AWSServiceName`: The service principal for the AWS service to which this role is attached. You use a string similar to a URL but without the http:// in front. For example: elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com.  Service principals are unique and case-sensitive. To find the exact service principal for your service-linked role, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide. Look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose the Yes link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.

# Optional Parameters
- `CustomSuffix`:  A string that you provide, which is combined with the service-provided prefix to form the complete role name. If you make multiple requests for the same service, then you must supply a different CustomSuffix for each request. Otherwise the request fails with a duplicate role name error. For example, you could add -1 or -debug to the suffix. Some services do not support the CustomSuffix parameter. If you provide an optional suffix and the operation fails, try the operation again without the suffix.
- `Description`: The description of the role.

    GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport()

Generates a report for service last accessed data for AWS Organizations. You can generate a report for any entities (organization root, organizational unit, or account) or policies in your organization. To call this operation, you must be signed in using your AWS Organizations master account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or root user credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have the required IAM and AWS Organizations permissions. For more information, see Refining Permissions Using Service Last Accessed Data in the IAM User Guide. You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity. You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional AWS Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see Reducing Permissions Using Service Last Accessed Data in the IAM User Guide.  The data includes all attempts to access AWS, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the AWS Management Console, the AWS API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see Logging IAM Events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide.  This operation returns a JobId. Use this parameter in the  GetOrganizationsAccessReport  operation to check the status of the report generation. To check the status of this request, use the JobId parameter in the  GetOrganizationsAccessReport  operation and test the JobStatus response parameter. When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report. To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path without specifying the optional AWS Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the report.    Root – When you specify the organizations root as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to your root. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization except the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs.    OU – When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the OU and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children. This data excludes the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs.    Master account – When you specify the master account, the resulting report lists all AWS services, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. For each service, the report includes data for only the master account.    Account – When you specify another account as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the account and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account.   To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity path and the optional AWS Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned for each service.    Root – When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization to which the SCP applies. This data excludes the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will return a list of services with no data.    OU – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. This data excludes the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report will return a list of services with no data.    Master account – When you specify the master account, the resulting report lists all AWS services, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for only the master account.    Account – When you specify another account entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. If the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will return a list of services with no data.    Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a principal could access a service. These other policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies SCP logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating Policies in the IAM User Guide.  For more information about service last accessed data, see Reducing Policy Scope by Viewing User Activity in the IAM User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `EntityPath`: The path of the AWS Organizations entity (root, OU, or account). You can build an entity path using the known structure of your organization.

    GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails()

Generates a report that includes details about when an IAM resource (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an attempt to access AWS services. Recent activity usually appears within four hours. IAM reports activity for the last 365 days, or less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year. For more information, see Regions Where Data Is Tracked.  The service last accessed data includes all attempts to access an AWS API, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the AWS Management Console, the AWS API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that your account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see Logging IAM Events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide.  The GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a JobId. Use this parameter in the following operations to retrieve the following details from your report:     GetServiceLastAccessedDetails – Use this operation for users, groups, roles, or policies to list every AWS service that the resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt. The JobId returned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail.    GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities – Use this operation for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific AWS service.    To check the status of the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails request, use the JobId parameter in the same operations and test the JobStatus response parameter. For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an identity (user, group, or role) to access specific services, use the ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess operation.  Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and AWS STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating Policies in the IAM User Guide.

    GetServiceLastAccessedDetails()

Retrieves a service last accessed report that was created using the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation. You can use the JobId parameter in GetServiceLastAccessedDetails to retrieve the status of your report job. When the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated report. The report includes a list of AWS services that the resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) can access.  Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and AWS STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating Policies in the IAM User Guide.  For each service that the resource could access using permissions policies, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, the GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns the reason that it failed. The GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a list of services. This list includes the number of entities that have attempted to access the service and the date and time of the last attempt. It also returns the ARN of the following entity, depending on the resource ARN that you used to generate the report:    User – Returns the user ARN that you used to generate the report    Group – Returns the ARN of the group member (user) that last attempted to access the service    Role – Returns the role ARN that you used to generate the report    Policy – Returns the ARN of the user or role that last used the policy to attempt to access the service   By default, the list is sorted by service namespace. If you specified ACTION_LEVEL granularity when you generated the report, this operation returns service and action last accessed data. This includes the most recent access attempt for each tracked action within a service. Otherwise, this operation returns only service data. For more information about service and action last accessed data, see Reducing Permissions Using Service Last Accessed Data in the IAM User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `JobId`: The ID of the request generated by the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation. The JobId returned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail.

# Optional Parameters
- `Marker`: Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
- `MaxItems`: Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response.

If there are no policies attached to the specified group (or none that match the specified path prefix), the operation returns an empty list.

# Required Parameters
- `GroupName`: The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the group to list attached policies for. This parameter allows (through its regex pattern) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

# Optional Parameters
- `Marker`: Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
- `MaxItems`: Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true. If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response element returns true, and Marker contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
- `PathPrefix`: The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies. This parameter allows (through its regex pattern) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (u0021) through the DEL character (u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

    ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess()

Retrieves a list of policies that the IAM identity (user, group, or role) can use to access each specified service.  This operation does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and AWS STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating Policies in the IAM User Guide.  The list of policies returned by the operation depends on the ARN of the identity that you provide.    User – The list of policies includes the managed and inline policies that are attached to the user directly. The list also includes any additional managed and inline policies that are attached to the group to which the user belongs.     Group – The list of policies includes only the managed and inline policies that are attached to the group directly. Policies that are attached to the group’s user are not included.    Role – The list of policies includes only the managed and inline policies that are attached to the role.   For each managed policy, this operation returns the ARN and policy name. For each inline policy, it returns the policy name and the entity to which it is attached. Inline policies do not have an ARN. For more information about these policy types, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the IAM User Guide. Policies that are attached to users and roles as permissions boundaries are not returned. To view which managed policy is currently used to set the permissions boundary for a user or role, use the GetUser or GetRole operations.

# Required Parameters

    SetSecurityTokenServicePreferences()

Sets the specified version of the global endpoint token as the token version used for the AWS account. By default, AWS Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all STS requests go to a single endpoint at https://sts.amazonaws.com. AWS recommends using Regional STS endpoints to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token availability. For information about Regional endpoints for STS, see AWS Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference. If you make an STS call to the global endpoint, the resulting session tokens might be valid in some Regions but not others. It depends on the version that is set in this operation. Version 1 tokens are valid only in AWS Regions that are available by default. These tokens do not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions. However, version 2 tokens are longer and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens. For information, see Activating and Deactivating STS in an AWS Region in the IAM User Guide. To view the current session token version, see the GlobalEndpointTokenVersion entry in the response of the GetAccountSummary operation.

# Required Parameters
- `GlobalEndpointTokenVersion`: The version of the global endpoint token. Version 1 tokens are valid only in AWS Regions that are available by default. These tokens do not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions.

    SimulateCustomPolicy()

Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource-based policy works with a list of API operations and AWS resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The policies are provided as strings. The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations. If you want to simulate existing policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role, use SimulatePrincipalPolicy instead. Context keys are variables that are maintained by AWS and its services and which provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the Condition element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy. If the output is long, you can use MaxItems and Marker parameters to paginate the results.

# Required Parameters
- `ActionNames`: A list of names of API operations to evaluate in the simulation. Each operation is evaluated against each resource. Each operation must include the service identifier, such as iam:CreateUser. This operation does not support using wildcards (*) in an action name.
- `PolicyInputList`: A list of policy documents to include in the simulation. Each document is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy. Do not include any resource-based policies in this parameter. Any resource-based policy must be submitted with the ResourcePolicy parameter. The policies cannot be \"scope-down\" policies, such as you could include in a call to GetFederationToken or one of the AssumeRole API operations. In other words, do not use policies designed to restrict what a user can do while using the temporary credentials. The regex pattern used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:   Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through u00FF)   The special characters tab (u0009), line feed (u000A), and carriage return (u000D)  

# Optional Parameters
- `CallerArn`: The ARN of the IAM user that you want to use as the simulated caller of the API operations. CallerArn is required if you include a ResourcePolicy so that the policy's Principal element has a value to use in evaluating the policy. You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.
- `ContextEntries`: A list of context keys and corresponding values for the simulation to use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.
- `Marker`: Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
- `MaxItems`: Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true. If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response element returns true, and Marker contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
- `PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList`: The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that an IAM entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see Permissions Boundaries for IAM Entities in the IAM User Guide. The policy input is specified as a string that contains the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy. The regex pattern used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:   Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through u00FF)   The special characters tab (u0009), line feed (u000A), and carriage return (u000D)  
- `ResourceArns`: A list of ARNs of AWS resources to include in the simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults to * (all resources). Each API in the ActionNames parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ResourcePolicy parameter. If you include a ResourcePolicy, then it must be applicable to all of the resources included in the simulation or you receive an invalid input error. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces in the AWS General Reference.
- `ResourceHandlingOption`: Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation. Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security-group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network-interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see Supported Platforms in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.    EC2-Classic-InstanceStore  instance, image, security-group    EC2-Classic-EBS  instance, image, security-group, volume    EC2-VPC-InstanceStore  instance, image, security-group, network-interface    EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet  instance, image, security-group, network-interface, subnet    EC2-VPC-EBS  instance, image, security-group, network-interface, volume    EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet  instance, image, security-group, network-interface, subnet, volume  
- `ResourceOwner`: An ARN representing the AWS account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in CallerArn. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn. The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:root. For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root. 
- `ResourcePolicy`: A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation. The regex pattern used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:   Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through u00FF)   The special characters tab (u0009), line feed (u000A), and carriage return (u000D)

    SimulatePrincipalPolicy()

Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list of API operations and AWS resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to. You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use SimulateCustomPolicy instead. You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation. The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations.  Note: This API discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use SimulateCustomPolicy instead. Context keys are variables maintained by AWS and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the Condition element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy. If the output is long, you can use the MaxItems and Marker parameters to paginate the results.

# Required Parameters
- `ActionNames`: A list of names of API operations to evaluate in the simulation. Each operation is evaluated for each resource. Each operation must include the service identifier, such as iam:CreateUser.
- `PolicySourceArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a user, group, or role whose policies you want to include in the simulation. If you specify a user, group, or role, the simulation includes all policies that are associated with that entity. If you specify a user, the simulation also includes all policies that are attached to any groups the user belongs to. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces in the AWS General Reference.

# Optional Parameters
- `CallerArn`: The ARN of the IAM user that you want to specify as the simulated caller of the API operations. If you do not specify a CallerArn, it defaults to the ARN of the user that you specify in PolicySourceArn, if you specified a user. If you include both a PolicySourceArn (for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David) and a CallerArn (for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob), the result is that you simulate calling the API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David's policies. You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.  CallerArn is required if you include a ResourcePolicy and the PolicySourceArn is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required so that the resource-based policy's Principal element has a value to use in evaluating the policy. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces in the AWS General Reference.
- `ContextEntries`: A list of context keys and corresponding values for the simulation to use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.
- `Marker`: Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.
- `MaxItems`: Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true. If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response element returns true, and Marker contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.
- `PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList`: The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary in effect at a time. For example, if a permissions boundary is attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the simulation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see Permissions Boundaries for IAM Entities in the IAM User Guide. The policy input is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy. The regex pattern used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:   Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through u00FF)   The special characters tab (u0009), line feed (u000A), and carriage return (u000D)  
- `PolicyInputList`: An optional list of additional policy documents to include in the simulation. Each document is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy. The regex pattern used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:   Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through u00FF)   The special characters tab (u0009), line feed (u000A), and carriage return (u000D)

- `ResourceOwner`: An AWS account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in CallerArn. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn.
- `ResourcePolicy`: A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached.

    TagRole()

Adds one or more tags to an IAM role. The role can be a regular role or a service-linked role. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value. A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:    Administrative grouping and discovery - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name Project and the value MyImportantProject. Or search for all resources with the key name Cost Center and the value 41200.     Access control - Reference tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM user or role that has a specified tag attached. You can also restrict access to only those resources that have a certain tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see Control Access Using IAM Tags in the IAM User Guide.    Cost allocation - Use tags to help track which individuals and teams are using which AWS resources.      Make sure that you have no invalid tags and that you do not exceed the allowed number of tags per role. In either case, the entire request fails and no tags are added to the role.   AWS always interprets the tag Value as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

Also note that some parameters do not allow the default parameter to be explicitly set. Instead, to invoke the default value, do not include that parameter when you invoke the operation.     For more information about using a password policy, see Managing an IAM Password Policy in the IAM User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
- `AllowUsersToChangePassword`:  Allows all IAM users in your account to use the AWS Management Console to change their own passwords. For more information, see Letting IAM Users Change Their Own Passwords in the IAM User Guide. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that IAM users in the account do not automatically have permissions to change their own password.
- `HardExpiry`: Prevents IAM users from setting a new password after their password has expired. The IAM user cannot be accessed until an administrator resets the password. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that IAM users can change their passwords after they expire and continue to sign in as the user.
- `MaxPasswordAge`: The number of days that an IAM user password is valid. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 0. The result is that IAM user passwords never expire.
- `MinimumPasswordLength`: The minimum number of characters allowed in an IAM user password. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 6.
- `PasswordReusePrevention`: Specifies the number of previous passwords that IAM users are prevented from reusing. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 0. The result is that IAM users are not prevented from reusing previous passwords.
- `RequireLowercaseCharacters`: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one lowercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (a to z). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one lowercase character.
- `RequireNumbers`: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one numeric character (0 to 9). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one numeric character.
- `RequireSymbols`: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one of the following non-alphanumeric characters: ! @ #  % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | ' If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one symbol character.
- `RequireUppercaseCharacters`: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one uppercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (A to Z). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one uppercase character.

For more information, see Renaming Users and Groups in the IAM User Guide.   The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the group named Managers to MGRs, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both groups. If the principal has permission to update the Managers group, but not the MGRs group, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see Access Management.

    UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint()

Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints. The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.) Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider's certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.  Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider's certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint operation to highly privileged users. 

# Required Parameters
- `OpenIDConnectProviderArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM OIDC provider resource object for which you want to update the thumbprint. You can get a list of OIDC provider ARNs by using the ListOpenIDConnectProviders operation. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces in the AWS General Reference.
