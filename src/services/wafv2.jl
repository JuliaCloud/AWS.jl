    AssociateWebACL()

 This is the latest version of AWS WAF, named AWS WAFV2, released in November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.   Associates a Web ACL with a regional application resource, to protect the resource. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or an API Gateway stage.  For AWS CloudFront, don't use this call. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a Web ACL, in the CloudFront call UpdateDistribution, set the web ACL ID to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Web ACL. For information, see UpdateDistribution.

# Required Parameters
- `ResourceArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to associate with the web ACL.  The ARN must be in one of the following formats:   For an Application Load Balancer: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region:account-id:loadbalancer/app/load-balancer-name/load-balancer-id     For an Amazon API Gateway stage: arn:aws:apigateway:region::/restapis/api-id/stages/stage-name    
- `WebACLArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Web ACL that you want to associate with the resource.

    CheckCapacity()

 This is the latest version of AWS WAF, named AWS WAFV2, released in November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.   Returns the web ACL capacity unit (WCU) requirements for a specified scope and set of rules. You can use this to check the capacity requirements for the rules you want to use in a RuleGroup or WebACL.  AWS WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. AWS WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500. 

# Required Parameters
- `Rules`: An array of Rule that you're configuring to use in a rule group or web ACL. 
- `Scope`: Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or an API Gateway stage.  To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:    CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1.    API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

    CreateRuleGroup()

 This is the latest version of AWS WAF, named AWS WAFV2, released in November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.   Creates a RuleGroup per the specifications provided.   A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a WebACL. When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements. 

# Required Parameters
- `Capacity`: The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group. When you create your own rule group, you define this, and you cannot change it after creation. When you add or modify the rules in a rule group, AWS WAF enforces this limit. You can check the capacity for a set of rules using CheckCapacity. AWS WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. AWS WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power.

API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.   
- `VisibilityConfig`: Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection. 

# Optional Parameters
- `Description`: A description of the rule group that helps with identification. You cannot change the description of a rule group after you create it.
- `Rules`: The Rule statements used to identify the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. Each rule includes one top-level statement that AWS WAF uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters that govern how AWS WAF handles them.

Gets detailed information about a specified number of requests--a sample--that AWS WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource received during a time range that you choose. You can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can specify any time range in the previous three hours.  GetSampledRequests returns a time range, which is usually the time range that you specified. However, if your resource (such as a CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before the specified time range elapsed, GetSampledRequests returns an updated time range. This new time range indicates the actual period during which AWS WAF selected the requests in the sample.

# Required Parameters
- `MaxItems`: The number of requests that you want AWS WAF to return from among the first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource received during the time range. If your resource received fewer requests than the value of MaxItems, GetSampledRequests returns information about all of them.

- `Id`: A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.
- `LockToken`: A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete. AWS WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException. If this happens, perform another get, and use the new token returned by that operation. 
- `Name`: The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an IPSet after you create it.
- `Scope`: Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or an API Gateway stage.  To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:    CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1.    API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.   

# Optional Parameters
- `Description`: A description of the IP set that helps with identification. You cannot change the description of an IP set after you create it.

    UpdateWebACL()

 This is the latest version of AWS WAF, named AWS WAFV2, released in November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.   Updates the specified WebACL.  A Web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has an action defined (allow, block, or count) for requests that match the statement of the rule. In the Web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a Web ACL can be a combination of the types Rule, RuleGroup, and managed rule group. You can associate a Web ACL with one or more AWS resources to protect. The resources can be Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway API, or an Application Load Balancer. 

# Required Parameters
- `DefaultAction`: The action to perform if none of the Rules contained in the WebACL match. 
- `Id`: The unique identifier for the Web ACL. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.
- `LockToken`: A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete.
