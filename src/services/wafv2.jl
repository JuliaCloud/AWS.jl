AWS WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. AWS WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power.
