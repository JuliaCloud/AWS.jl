    associate_file_system_aliases(aliases, file_system_id)
    associate_file_system_aliases(aliases, file_system_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Use this action to associate one or more Domain Name Server (DNS) aliases with an existing
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. A file system can have a maximum of 50 DNS
aliases associated with it at any one time. If you try to associate a DNS alias that is
already associated with the file system, FSx takes no action on that alias in the request.
For more information, see Working with DNS Aliases and Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to
access your file system, including additional steps you must take to be able to access your
file system using a DNS alias. The system response shows the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is
attempting to associate with the file system. Use the API operation to monitor the status
of the aliases Amazon FSx is associating with the file system.

# Arguments
- `aliases`: An array of one or more DNS alias names to associate with the file system. The
  alias name has to comply with the following formatting requirements:   Formatted as a
  fully-qualified domain name (FQDN),  hostname.domain , for example,
  accounting.corp.example.com.   Can contain alphanumeric characters and the hyphen (-).
  Cannot start or end with a hyphen.   Can start with a numeric.   For DNS alias names,
  Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you
  specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in
  escape codes.
- `file_system_id`: Specifies the file system with which you want to associate one or more
  DNS aliases.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`:

    copy_backup(source_backup_id)
    copy_backup(source_backup_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Copies an existing backup within the same Amazon Web Services account to another Amazon Web
Services Region (cross-Region copy) or within the same Amazon Web Services Region
(in-Region copy). You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single
destination Region per account. You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-region
disaster recovery. You periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in
the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover
availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your
Amazon Web Services partition.  You can also use backup copies to clone your file data set
to another Region or within the same Region. You can use the SourceRegion parameter to
specify the Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup will be copied. For example,
if you make the call from the us-west-1 Region and want to copy a backup from the us-east-2
Region, you specify us-east-2 in the SourceRegion parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If
you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request
is sent from (in-Region copy). For more information on creating backup copies, see  Copying
backups in the Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide and Copying backups in the Amazon FSx for
Lustre User Guide.

# Arguments
- `source_backup_id`: The ID of the source backup. Specifies the ID of the backup that is
  being copied.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`:
- `"CopyTags"`: A boolean flag indicating whether tags from the source backup should be
  copied to the backup copy. This value defaults to false. If you set CopyTags to true and
  the source backup has existing tags, you can use the Tags parameter to create new tags,
  provided that the sum of the source backup tags and the new tags doesn't exceed 50. Both
  sets of tags are merged. If there are tag conflicts (for example, two tags with the same
  key but different values), the tags created with the Tags parameter take precedence.
- `"KmsKeyId"`:
- `"SourceRegion"`: The source Amazon Web Services Region of the backup. Specifies the
  Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup is being copied. The source and
  destination Regions must be in the same Amazon Web Services partition. If you don't specify
  a Region, it defaults to the Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).

    create_backup()
    create_backup(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server or Amazon FSx for Lustre
file system, or of an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP volume. Creating regular backups is a
best practice, enabling you to restore a file system or volume from a backup if an issue
arises with the original file system or volume. For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you
can create a backup only for file systems with the following configuration:   a Persistent
deployment type   is not linked to a data repository.   For more information about backups,
see the following:   For Amazon FSx for Lustre, see Working with FSx for Lustre backups.
For Amazon FSx for Windows, see Working with FSx for Windows backups.   For Amazon FSx for
NetApp ONTAP, see Working with FSx for NetApp ONTAP backups.   If a backup with the
specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this operation returns the
description of the existing backup. If a backup specified client request token exists, and
the parameters don't match, this operation returns IncompatibleParameterError. If a backup
with the specified client request token doesn't exist, CreateBackup does the following:
Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of
CREATING.   Returns the description of the backup.   By using the idempotent operation, you
can retry a CreateBackup operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This
approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a
backup was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a
backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same.
The CreateBackup operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still CREATING.
You can check the backup creation status by calling the DescribeBackups operation, which
returns the backup state along with other information.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: (Optional) A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx
  uses to ensure idempotent creation. This string is automatically filled on your behalf when
  you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web Services SDK.
- `"FileSystemId"`: The ID of the file system to back up.
- `"Tags"`: (Optional) The tags to apply to the backup at backup creation. The key value of
  the Name tag appears in the console as the backup name. If you have set CopyTagsToBackups
  to true, and you specify one or more tags using the CreateBackup action, no existing file
  system tags are copied from the file system to the backup.
- `"VolumeId"`: The ID of he FSx for NetApp ONTAP volume to back up.

    create_data_repository_task(file_system_id, report, type, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task. You use data repository tasks to
perform bulk operations between your Amazon FSx file system and its linked data repository.
An example of a data repository task is exporting any data and metadata changes, including
POSIX metadata, to files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks) from your FSx file
system to its linked data repository. A CreateDataRepositoryTask operation will fail if a
data repository is not linked to the FSx file system. To learn more about data repository
tasks, see Data Repository Tasks. To learn more about linking a data repository to your
file system, see Linking your file system to an S3 bucket.

# Arguments
- `file_system_id`:
- `report`: Defines whether or not Amazon FSx provides a CompletionReport once the task has
  completed. A CompletionReport provides a detailed report on the files that Amazon FSx
  processed that meet the criteria specified by the Scope parameter. For more information,
  see Working with Task Completion Reports.
- `type`: Specifies the type of data repository task to create.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`:
- `"Paths"`: (Optional) The path or paths on the Amazon FSx file system to use when the
  data repository task is processed. The default path is the file system root directory. The
  paths you provide need to be relative to the mount point of the file system. If the mount
  point is /mnt/fsx and /mnt/fsx/path1 is a directory or file on the file system you want to
  export, then the path to provide is path1. If a path that you provide isn't valid, the task
  fails.

Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system. If a file system with the specified client
request token exists and the parameters match, CreateFileSystem returns the description of
the existing file system. If a file system specified client request token exists and the
parameters don't match, this call returns IncompatibleParameterError. If a file system with
the specified client request token doesn't exist, CreateFileSystem does the following:
Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle
state of CREATING.   Returns the description of the file system.   This operation requires
a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation.
This means that calling the operation multiple times with the same client request token has
no effect. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateFileSystem operation
without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an
initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created.
Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you
use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client
receives success as long as the parameters are the same.  The CreateFileSystem call returns
while the file system's lifecycle state is still CREATING. You can check the file-system
creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system
state along with other information.

# Arguments
- `file_system_type`: The type of Amazon FSx file system to create. Valid values are
  WINDOWS, LUSTRE, and ONTAP.
- `storage_capacity`: Sets the storage capacity of the file system that you're creating.
  For Lustre file systems:   For SCRATCH_2 and PERSISTENT_1 SSD deployment types, valid
  values are 1200 GiB, 2400 GiB, and increments of 2400 GiB.   For PERSISTENT HDD file
  systems, valid values are increments of 6000 GiB for 12 MB/s/TiB file systems and
  increments of 1800 GiB for 40 MB/s/TiB file systems.   For SCRATCH_1 deployment type, valid
  values are 1200 GiB, 2400 GiB, and increments of 3600 GiB.   For Windows file systems:   If
  StorageType=SSD, valid values are 32 GiB - 65,536 GiB (64 TiB).   If StorageType=HDD, valid
  values are 2000 GiB - 65,536 GiB (64 TiB).   For ONTAP file systems:   Valid values are
  1024 GiB - 196,608 GiB (192 TiB).
- `subnet_ids`: Specifies the IDs of the subnets that the file system will be accessible
  from. For Windows and ONTAP MULTI_AZ_1 file system deployment types, provide exactly two
  subnet IDs, one for the preferred file server and one for the standby file server. You
  specify one of these subnets as the preferred subnet using the WindowsConfiguration &gt;
  PreferredSubnetID or OntapConfiguration &gt; PreferredSubnetID properties. For more
  information, see  Availability and durability: Single-AZ and Multi-AZ file systems in the
  Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide and  Availability and durability in the Amazon FSx for
  ONTAP User Guide. For Windows SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2 file system deployment types and
  Lustre file systems, provide exactly one subnet ID. The file server is launched in that
  subnet's Availability Zone.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ActiveDirectoryConfiguration"`: Describes the self-managed Microsoft Active Directory
  to which you want to join the SVM. Joining an Active Directory provides user authentication
  and access control for SMB clients, including Microsoft Windows and macOS client accessing
  the file system.
- `"ClientRequestToken"`:
- `"RootVolumeSecurityStyle"`: The security style of the root volume of the SVM. Specify
  one of the following values:    UNIX if the file system is managed by a UNIX administrator,
  the majority of users are NFS clients, and an application accessing the data uses a UNIX
  user as the service account.    NTFS if the file system is managed by a Windows
  administrator, the majority of users are SMB clients, and an application accessing the data
  uses a Windows user as the service account.    MIXED if the file system is managed by both
  UNIX and Windows administrators and users consist of both NFS and SMB clients.
- `"SvmAdminPassword"`: The password to use when managing the SVM using the NetApp ONTAP
  CLI or REST API. If you do not specify a password, you can still use the file system's
  fsxadmin user to manage the SVM.

Deletes a file system, deleting its contents. After deletion, the file system no longer

delete an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, first delete all the volumes and SVMs on
the file system. Then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleFileSystem operation. By
default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup
is created upon deletion. This final backup is not subject to the file system's retention
policy, and must be manually deleted. The DeleteFileSystem action returns while the file
system has the DELETING status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling
the DescribeFileSystems action, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If
you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems returns a
FileSystemNotFound error.  Deleting an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with a
400 BadRequest if a data repository task is in a PENDING or EXECUTING state.   The data in
a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be recovered by any means.

    list_tags_for_resource(resource_arn)
    list_tags_for_resource(resource_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Lists tags for an Amazon FSx file systems and backups in the case of Amazon FSx for Windows
File Server. When retrieving all tags, you can optionally specify the MaxResults parameter
to limit the number of tags in a response. If more tags remain, Amazon FSx returns a
NextToken value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the NextToken
request parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last response. This action is used
in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your tags. ListTagsForResource is called
first without a NextTokenvalue. Then the action continues to be called with the NextToken
parameter set to the value of the last NextToken value until a response has no NextToken.
When using this action, keep the following in mind:   The implementation might return fewer
than MaxResults file system descriptions while still including a NextToken value.   The
order of tags returned in the response of one ListTagsForResource call and the order of
tags returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

# Arguments
- `resource_arn`: The ARN of the Amazon FSx resource that will have its tags listed.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"MaxResults"`: Maximum number of tags to return in the response (integer). This
  parameter value must be greater than 0. The number of items that Amazon FSx returns is the
  minimum of the MaxResults parameter specified in the request and the service's internal
  maximum number of items per page.
- `"NextToken"`: Opaque pagination token returned from a previous ListTagsForResource
  operation (String). If a token present, the action continues the list from where the
  returning call left off.

# Arguments
- `file_system_id`: Identifies the file system that you are updating.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to
  ensure idempotent updates. This string is automatically filled on your behalf when you use
  the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web Services SDK.
- `"LustreConfiguration"`:
- `"OntapConfiguration"`:
- `"StorageCapacity"`: Use this parameter to increase the storage capacity of an Amazon FSx
  for Windows File Server or Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Specifies the storage
  capacity target value, GiB, to increase the storage capacity for the file system that
  you're updating. You cannot make a storage capacity increase request if there is an
  existing storage capacity increase request in progress. For Windows file systems, the
  storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent (%) greater than the current
  storage capacity value. In order to increase storage capacity, the file system must have at
  least 16 MB/s of throughput capacity. For Lustre file systems, the storage capacity target
  value can be the following:   For SCRATCH_2 and PERSISTENT_1 SSD deployment types, valid
  values are in multiples of 2400 GiB. The value must be greater than the current storage
  capacity.   For PERSISTENT HDD file systems, valid values are multiples of 6000 GiB for 12
  MB/s/TiB file systems and multiples of 1800 GiB for 40 MB/s/TiB file systems. The values
  must be greater than the current storage capacity.   For SCRATCH_1 file systems, you cannot
  increase the storage capacity.   For more information, see Managing storage capacity in the
  Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide and Managing storage and throughput capacity
  in the Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide.
