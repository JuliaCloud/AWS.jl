    describe_affected_accounts_for_organization(event_arn)
    describe_affected_accounts_for_organization(event_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Returns a list of accounts in the organization from AWS Organizations that are affected by
the provided event. For more information about the different types of AWS Health events,
see Event.  Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to work
with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization
operation from your organization's management account.  This API operation uses pagination.
Specify the nextToken parameter in the next request to return more results.

# Arguments
- `event_arn`: The unique identifier for the event. Format:
  arn:aws:health:event-region::event/SERVICE/EVENT_TYPE_CODE/EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID . Example:
  Example:
  arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMEN
  T_SCHEDULED_ABC123-DEF456

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"maxResults"`: The maximum number of items to return in one batch, between 10 and 100,
  inclusive.
- `"nextToken"`: If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are
  returned, and a nextToken pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the
  next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all
  results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.

customer resources, or any other construct, depending on the AWS service. Events that have
impact beyond that of the affected entities, or where the extent of impact is unknown,
include at least one entity indicating this. At least one event ARN is required. Results
are sorted by the lastUpdatedTime of the entity, starting with the most recent.    This API

detailed event description, and possible additional metadata that depends upon the nature
of the event. Affected entities are not included. To retrieve those, use the

possible additional metadata that depends upon the nature of the event. Affected entities

operation. Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to work
with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization
operation from your organization's management account. When you call the
DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation, you specify the
organizationEventDetailFilters object in the request. Depending on the AWS Health event
type, note the following differences:   If the event is public, the awsAccountId parameter
must be empty. If you specify an account ID for a public event, then an error message is
returned. That's because the event might apply to all AWS accounts and isn't specific to an
account in your organization.   If the event is specific to an account, then you must
specify the awsAccountId parameter in the request. If you don't specify an account ID, an
error message returns because the event is specific to an AWS account in your organization.

 Returns information about events that meet the specified filter criteria. Events are

information, use the DescribeEventDetails and DescribeAffectedEntities operations. If no
filter criteria are specified, all events are returned. Results are sorted by
lastModifiedTime, starting with the most recent event.    When you call the DescribeEvents
operation and specify an entity for the entityValues parameter, AWS Health might return
public events that aren't specific to that resource. For example, if you call
DescribeEvents and specify an ID for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance,
AWS Health might return events that aren't specific to that resource or service. To get
