    DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization()

Returns a list of accounts in the organization from AWS Organizations that are affected by the provided event. For more information about the different types of AWS Health events, see Event.  Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to work with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization operation from your organization's master account.  This API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken parameter in the next request to return more results. 

# Required Parameters
- `eventArn`: The unique identifier for the event. Format: arn:aws:health:event-region::event/SERVICE/EVENT_TYPE_CODE/EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID . Example: Example: arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-DEF456 

# Optional Parameters
- `maxResults`: The maximum number of items to return in one batch, between 10 and 100, inclusive.
- `nextToken`: If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are returned, and a nextToken pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.

    DescribeAffectedEntities()

Returns a list of entities that have been affected by the specified events, based on the specified filter criteria. Entities can refer to individual customer resources, groups of customer resources, or any other construct, depending on the AWS service. Events that have impact beyond that of the affected entities, or where the extent of impact is unknown, include at least one entity indicating this. At least one event ARN is required. Results are sorted by the lastUpdatedTime of the entity, starting with the most recent.  This API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken parameter in the next request to return more results. 

# Required Parameters
- `filter`: Values to narrow the results returned. At least one event ARN is required.

Affected entities are not included; to retrieve those, use the DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization operation.

To do this, call the EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization operation from your organization's master account. When you call the DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation, you specify the organizationEventDetailFilters object in the request. Depending on the AWS Health event type, note the following differences:   If the event is public, the awsAccountId parameter must be empty. If you specify an account ID for a public event, then an error message is returned. That's because the event might apply to all AWS accounts and isn't specific to an account in your organization.   If the event is specific to an account, then you must specify the awsAccountId parameter in the request. If you don't specify an account ID, an error message returns because the event is specific to an AWS account in your organization.    For more information, see Event.

    DescribeEvents()

 Returns information about events that meet the specified filter criteria.

Results are sorted by lastModifiedTime, starting with the most recent event.    When you call the DescribeEvents operation and specify an entity for the entityValues parameter, AWS Health might return public events that aren't specific to that resource. For example, if you call DescribeEvents and specify an ID for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, AWS Health might return events that aren't specific to that resource or service.
