    create_addon(addon_name, name)
    create_addon(addon_name, name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon EKS add-on. Amazon EKS add-ons help to automate the provisioning and
lifecycle management of common operational software for Amazon EKS clusters. Amazon EKS
add-ons can only be used with Amazon EKS clusters running version 1.18 with platform
version eks.3 or later because add-ons rely on the Server-side Apply Kubernetes feature,
which is only available in Kubernetes 1.18 and later.

# Arguments
- `addon_name`: The name of the add-on. The name must match one of the names returned by
  ListAddons .
- `name`: The name of the cluster to create the add-on for.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"addonVersion"`: The version of the add-on. The version must match one of the versions
  returned by  DescribeAddonVersions .

    create_cluster(name, resources_vpc_config, role_arn)
    create_cluster(name, resources_vpc_config, role_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.  The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control
plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, such as etcd and the API server. The
control plane runs in an account managed by AWS, and the Kubernetes API is exposed via the
Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single-tenant and
unique and runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances. The cluster control plane is
provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing
Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC
subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example,
to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). Amazon EKS nodes run in your AWS
account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes API server endpoint
and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. Cluster creation typically takes
several minutes. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes
tooling to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster. For more
information, see Managing Cluster Authentication and Launching Amazon EKS nodes in the
Amazon EKS User Guide.

# Arguments
- `name`: The unique name to give to your cluster.
- `resources_vpc_config`: The VPC configuration used by the cluster control plane. Amazon
  EKS VPC resources have specific requirements to work properly with Kubernetes. For more
  information, see Cluster VPC Considerations and Cluster Security Group Considerations in
  the Amazon EKS User Guide. You must specify at least two subnets. You can specify up to
  five security groups, but we recommend that you use a dedicated security group for your
  cluster control plane.
- `role_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that provides permissions for
  the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to AWS API operations on your behalf. For more
  information, see Amazon EKS Service IAM Role in the  Amazon EKS User Guide .

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientRequestToken"`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.
- `"encryptionConfig"`: The encryption configuration for the cluster.
- `"kubernetesNetworkConfig"`: The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.
- `"logging"`: Enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your
  cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to
  CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs in the
  Amazon EKS User Guide .  CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning
  rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch
  Pricing.
- `"tags"`: The metadata to apply to the cluster to assist with categorization and
  organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
- `"version"`: The desired Kubernetes version for your cluster. If you don't specify a
  value here, the latest version available in Amazon EKS is used.

    create_fargate_profile(fargate_profile_name, name, pod_execution_role_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an AWS Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You must have at least one
Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods on Fargate. The Fargate profile allows
an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which
Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profile’s selectors. Each profile
can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required
for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods
that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of
the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate. When you create a
Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are
scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes Role Based
Access Control (RBAC) for authorization so that the kubelet that is running on the Fargate
infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your
cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate
infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information,
see Pod Execution Role in the Amazon EKS User Guide. Fargate profiles are immutable.
However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then
delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating. If any Fargate
profiles in a cluster are in the DELETING status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to
finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster. For more
information, see AWS Fargate Profile in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

# Arguments
- `fargate_profile_name`: The name of the Fargate profile.
- `name`: The name of the Amazon EKS cluster to apply the Fargate profile to.
- `pod_execution_role_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pod execution role to use
  for pods that match the selectors in the Fargate profile. The pod execution role allows
  Fargate infrastructure to register with your cluster as a node, and it provides read access
  to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see Pod Execution Role in the
  Amazon EKS User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientRequestToken"`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.
- `"selectors"`: The selectors to match for pods to use this Fargate profile. Each selector
  must have an associated namespace. Optionally, you can also specify labels for a namespace.
  You may specify up to five selectors in a Fargate profile.
- `"subnets"`: The IDs of subnets to launch your pods into. At this time, pods running on
  Fargate are not assigned public IP addresses, so only private subnets (with no direct route
  to an Internet Gateway) are accepted for this parameter.
- `"tags"`: The metadata to apply to the Fargate profile to assist with categorization and
  organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
  Fargate profile tags do not propagate to any other resources associated with the Fargate
  profile, such as the pods that are scheduled with it.

    create_nodegroup(name, node_role, nodegroup_name, subnets)
    create_nodegroup(name, node_role, nodegroup_name, subnets, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a managed node group for an Amazon EKS cluster. You can only create a node group
for your cluster that is equal to the current Kubernetes version for the cluster. All node
groups are created with the latest AMI release version for the respective minor Kubernetes
version of the cluster, unless you deploy a custom AMI using a launch template. For more
information about using launch templates, see Launch template support. An Amazon EKS
managed node group is an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and associated Amazon EC2 instances
that are managed by AWS for an Amazon EKS cluster. Each node group uses a version of the
Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see Managed Node Groups in
the Amazon EKS User Guide.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the cluster to create the node group in.
- `node_role`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with your node
  group. The Amazon EKS worker node kubelet daemon makes calls to AWS APIs on your behalf.
  Nodes receive permissions for these API calls through an IAM instance profile and
  associated policies. Before you can launch nodes and register them into a cluster, you must
  create an IAM role for those nodes to use when they are launched. For more information, see
  Amazon EKS node IAM role in the  Amazon EKS User Guide . If you specify launchTemplate,
  then don't specify  IamInstanceProfile  in your launch template, or the node group
  deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS,
  see Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
- `nodegroup_name`: The unique name to give your node group.
- `subnets`: The subnets to use for the Auto Scaling group that is created for your node
  group. These subnets must have the tag key kubernetes.io/cluster/CLUSTER_NAME with a value
  of shared, where CLUSTER_NAME is replaced with the name of your cluster. If you specify
  launchTemplate, then don't specify  SubnetId  in your launch template, or the node group
  deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS,
  see Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"amiType"`: The AMI type for your node group. GPU instance types should use the
  AL2_x86_64_GPU AMI type. Non-GPU instances should use the AL2_x86_64 AMI type. Arm
  instances should use the AL2_ARM_64 AMI type. All types use the Amazon EKS optimized Amazon
  Linux 2 AMI. If you specify launchTemplate, and your launch template uses a custom AMI,
  then don't specify amiType, or the node group deployment will fail. For more information
  about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template support in the Amazon EKS
  User Guide.
- `"capacityType"`: The capacity type for your node group.
- `"clientRequestToken"`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.
- `"diskSize"`: The root device disk size (in GiB) for your node group instances. The
  default disk size is 20 GiB. If you specify launchTemplate, then don't specify diskSize, or
  the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using launch templates with
  Amazon EKS, see Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
- `"instanceTypes"`: Specify the instance types for a node group. If you specify a GPU
  instance type, be sure to specify AL2_x86_64_GPU with the amiType parameter. If you specify
  launchTemplate, then you can specify zero or one instance type in your launch template or
  you can specify 0-20 instance types for instanceTypes. If however, you specify an instance
  type in your launch template and specify any instanceTypes, the node group deployment will
  fail. If you don't specify an instance type in a launch template or for instanceTypes, then
  t3.medium is used, by default. If you specify Spot for capacityType, then we recommend
  specifying multiple values for instanceTypes. For more information, see Managed node group
  capacity types and Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
- `"labels"`: The Kubernetes labels to be applied to the nodes in the node group when they
  are created.
- `"launchTemplate"`: An object representing a node group's launch template specification.
  If specified, then do not specify instanceTypes, diskSize, or remoteAccess and make sure
  that the launch template meets the requirements in launchTemplateSpecification.
- `"releaseVersion"`: The AMI version of the Amazon EKS optimized AMI to use with your node
  group. By default, the latest available AMI version for the node group's current Kubernetes
  version is used. For more information, see Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI versions
  in the Amazon EKS User Guide. If you specify launchTemplate, and your launch template uses
  a custom AMI, then don't specify releaseVersion, or the node group deployment will fail.
  For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template
  support in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
- `"remoteAccess"`: The remote access (SSH) configuration to use with your node group. If
  you specify launchTemplate, then don't specify remoteAccess, or the node group deployment
  will fail. For more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch
  template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
- `"scalingConfig"`: The scaling configuration details for the Auto Scaling group that is
  created for your node group.
- `"tags"`: The metadata to apply to the node group to assist with categorization and
  organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
  Node group tags do not propagate to any other resources associated with the node group,
  such as the Amazon EC2 instances or subnets.
- `"version"`: The Kubernetes version to use for your managed nodes. By default, the
  Kubernetes version of the cluster is used, and this is the only accepted specified value.
  If you specify launchTemplate, and your launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't
  specify version, or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about using
  launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

Updates the Kubernetes version or AMI version of an Amazon EKS managed node group. You can
update a node group using a launch template only if the node group was originally deployed
with a launch template. If you need to update a custom AMI in a node group that was
deployed with a launch template, then update your custom AMI, specify the new ID in a new
version of the launch template, and then update the node group to the new version of the
launch template. If you update without a launch template, then you can update to the latest
available AMI version of a node group's current Kubernetes version by not specifying a
Kubernetes version in the request. You can update to the latest AMI version of your
cluster's current Kubernetes version by specifying your cluster's Kubernetes version in the
request. For more information, see Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI versions in the
Amazon EKS User Guide. You cannot roll back a node group to an earlier Kubernetes version
or AMI version. When a node in a managed node group is terminated due to a scaling action
or update, the pods in that node are drained first. Amazon EKS attempts to drain the nodes
gracefully and will fail if it is unable to do so. You can force the update if Amazon EKS
is unable to drain the nodes as a result of a pod disruption budget issue.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the Amazon EKS cluster that is associated with the managed node group
  to update.
- `nodegroup_name`: The name of the managed node group to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientRequestToken"`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.
- `"force"`: Force the update if the existing node group's pods are unable to be drained
  due to a pod disruption budget issue. If an update fails because pods could not be drained,
  you can force the update after it fails to terminate the old node whether or not any pods
  are running on the node.
- `"launchTemplate"`: An object representing a node group's launch template specification.
  You can only update a node group using a launch template if the node group was originally
  deployed with a launch template.
- `"releaseVersion"`: The AMI version of the Amazon EKS optimized AMI to use for the
  update. By default, the latest available AMI version for the node group's Kubernetes
  version is used. For more information, see Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI versions
   in the Amazon EKS User Guide. If you specify launchTemplate, and your launch template uses
  a custom AMI, then don't specify releaseVersion, or the node group update will fail. For
  more information about using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template support
  in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
- `"version"`: The Kubernetes version to update to. If no version is specified, then the
  Kubernetes version of the node group does not change. You can specify the Kubernetes
  version of the cluster to update the node group to the latest AMI version of the cluster's
  Kubernetes version. If you specify launchTemplate, and your launch template uses a custom
  AMI, then don't specify version, or the node group update will fail. For more information
