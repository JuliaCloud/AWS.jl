    accept_handshake(handshake_id)
    accept_handshake(handshake_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Sends a response to the originator of a handshake agreeing to the action proposed by the
handshake request. This operation can be called only by the following principals when they
also have the relevant IAM permissions:    Invitation to join or Approve all features
request handshakes: only a principal from the member account. The user who calls the API
for an invitation to join must have the organizations:AcceptHandshake permission. If you
enabled all features in the organization, the user must also have the
iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission so that Organizations can create the required
service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see
Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the Organizations User Guide.    Enable all
features final confirmation handshake: only a principal from the management account. For
more information about invitations, see Inviting an Amazon Web Services account to join
your organization in the Organizations User Guide. For more information about requests to
enable all features in the organization, see Enabling all features in your organization in
the Organizations User Guide.    After you accept a handshake, it continues to appear in
the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.

# Arguments
- `handshake_id`: The unique identifier (ID) of the handshake that you want to accept. The
  regex pattern for handshake ID string requires \"h-\" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase
  letters or digits.

  target. You can get the ID for the policy by calling the ListPolicies operation. The regex
  pattern for a policy ID string requires \"p-\" followed by from 8 to 128 lowercase or
  uppercase letters, digits, or the underscore character (_).
- `target_id`: The unique identifier (ID) of the root, OU, or account that you want to
  attach the policy to. You can get the ID by calling the ListRoots,
  ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent, or ListAccounts operations. The regex pattern for a
  target ID string requires one of the following:    Root - A string that begins with \"r-\"
  followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.    Account - A string that consists
  of exactly 12 digits.    Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins with \"ou-\"

    close_account(account_id)
    close_account(account_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Closes an Amazon Web Services member account within an organization. You can't close the
management account with this API. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services
performs in the background. Because CloseAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a
successful completion message even though account closure might still be in progress. You
need to wait a few minutes before the account is fully closed. To check the status of the
request, do one of the following:   Use the AccountId that you sent in the CloseAccount
request to provide as a parameter to the DescribeAccount operation.  While the close
account request is in progress, Account status will indicate PENDING_CLOSURE. When the
close account request completes, the status will change to SUSPENDED.    Check the
CloudTrail log for the CloseAccountResult event that gets published after the account
closes successfully. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see Logging
and monitoring in Organizations in the Organizations User Guide.       You can only close
10% of active member accounts within a rolling 30 day period. This quota is not bound by a
calendar month, but starts when you close an account. Within 30 days of that initial
account closure, you can't exceed the 10% account closure limit.   To reinstate a closed
account, contact Amazon Web Services Support within the 90-day grace period while the
account is in SUSPENDED status.    If the Amazon Web Services account you attempt to close
is linked to an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account, the CloseAccount request will
close both accounts. To learn important pre-closure details, see  Closing an Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) account in the  Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.    For more
information about closing accounts, see Closing an Amazon Web Services account in the
Organizations User Guide.

    create_account(account_name, email)
    create_account(account_name, email, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon Web Services account that is automatically a member of the organization
whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web
Services performs in the background. Because CreateAccount operates asynchronously, it can
return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in
progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the Id member
of the CreateAccountStatus response element from this operation to provide as a parameter
to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the CloudTrail log for the
CreateAccountResult event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see
Logging and monitoring in Organizations in the Organizations User Guide.    The user who
calls the API to create an account must have the organizations:CreateAccount permission. If
you enabled all features in the organization, Organizations creates the required
service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see
Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the Organizations User Guide. If the request
includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission.
Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named
OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default) that grants users in the management account
administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account
can assume the role. Organizations clones the company name and address information for the
new account from the organization's management account. This operation can be called only
from the organization's management account. For more information about creating accounts,
see Creating an Amazon Web Services account in Your Organization in the Organizations User
Guide.     When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console,
API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone
account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is not
automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you
can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at  To leave an
organization as a member account in the Organizations User Guide.   If you get an exception
that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact Amazon
Web Services Support.   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the
error persists, contact Amazon Web Services Support.   Using CreateAccount to create
multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the
Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For
information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see Closing an Amazon
Web Services account in the Organizations User Guide.     When you create a member account
with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the IAM User and
Role Access to Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles
that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you
disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information
about how to disable this switch for an account, see Granting Access to Your Billing
Information and Tools.

# Arguments
- `account_name`: The friendly name of the member account.
- `email`: The email address of the owner to assign to the new member account. This email
  address must not already be associated with another Amazon Web Services account. You must
  use a valid email address to complete account creation. The rules for a valid email
  address:   The address must be a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 64 characters long.   All
  characters must be 7-bit ASCII characters.   There must be one and only one @ symbol, which
  separates the local name from the domain name.   The local name can't contain any of the
  following characters: whitespace, \" ' ( ) &lt; &gt; [ ] : ; ,  | % &amp;   The local name
  can't begin with a dot (.)   The domain name can consist of only the characters
  [a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.)   The domain name can't begin or end with a
  hyphen (-) or dot (.)   The domain name must contain at least one dot   You can't access
  the root user of the account or remove an account that was created with an invalid email
  address.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"IamUserAccessToBilling"`: If set to ALLOW, the new account enables IAM users to access
  account billing information if they have the required permissions. If set to DENY, only the
  root user of the new account can access account billing information. For more information,
  see Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console in the Amazon Web Services
  Billing and Cost Management User Guide. If you don't specify this parameter, the value
  defaults to ALLOW, and IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access billing
  information for the new account.
- `"RoleName"`: (Optional) The name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically
  preconfigures in the new member account. This role trusts the management account, allowing
  users in the management account to assume the role, as permitted by the management account
  administrator. The role has administrator permissions in the new member account. If you
  don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to OrganizationAccountAccessRole. For
  more information about how to use this role to access the member account, see the following

  Services accounts Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide    The regex pattern that is used
  to validate this parameter. The pattern can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
  digits with no spaces, and any of the following characters: =,.@-
- `"Tags"`: A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account. For each
  tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and a value. You can set the value to an
  empty string, but you can't set it to null. For more information about tagging, see Tagging
  Organizations resources in the Organizations User Guide.  If any one of the tags is invalid
  or if you exceed the maximum allowed number of tags for an account, then the entire request
  fails and the account is not created.

    create_gov_cloud_account(account_name, email)
    create_gov_cloud_account(account_name, email, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

This action is available if all of the following are true:   You're authorized to create
accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. For more information on the
Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region, see the  Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.
   You already have an account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region that is
paired with a management account of an organization in the commercial Region.   You call
this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region.
You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission.    Organizations automatically
creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more
information, see Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the Organizations User Guide.
Amazon Web Services automatically enables CloudTrail for Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
accounts, but you should also do the following:   Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to
store logs.   Create an Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage. For more information,
see Verifying CloudTrail Is Enabled in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.    If
the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource
permission. The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud
account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call
the TagResource operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists. You
call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region
to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the
Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more
information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to
join an organization, see Organizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.
Calling CreateGovCloudAccount is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs
in the background. Because CreateGovCloudAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a
successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in
progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the OperationId
response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the
DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the CloudTrail log for the
CreateAccountResult event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see
Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the Organizations User Guide.     When you
call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the
Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region
for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a
member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated
with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region
that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume
it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the
commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For
more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see
Organizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.  For more information about
creating accounts, see Creating an Amazon Web Services account in Your Organization in the
Organizations User Guide.     When you create an account in an organization using the
Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to
operate as a standalone account is not automatically collected. This includes a payment

Using CreateGovCloudAccount to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You
can only close an account from the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management console,
and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process
for closing an account, see Closing an Amazon Web Services account in the Organizations
User Guide.     When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information
switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can
view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can
access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an
account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools.

# Arguments
- `account_name`: The friendly name of the member account.  The account name can consist of
  only the characters [a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.) You can't separate characters
  with a dash (–).
- `email`: Specifies the email address of the owner to assign to the new member account in
  the commercial Region. This email address must not already be associated with another

  dot   You can't access the root user of the account or remove an account that was created
  with an invalid email address. Like all request parameters for CreateGovCloudAccount, the
  request for the email address for the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account originates
  from the commercial Region, not from the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"IamUserAccessToBilling"`: If set to ALLOW, the new linked account in the commercial
  Region enables IAM users to access account billing information if they have the required
  permissions. If set to DENY, only the root user of the new account can access account
  billing information. For more information, see Activating Access to the Billing and Cost
  Management Console in the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide.  If
  you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to ALLOW, and IAM users and roles with
  the required permissions can access billing information for the new account.
- `"RoleName"`: (Optional) The name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically
  preconfigures in the new member accounts in both the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
  Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the management account, allowing
  users in the management account to assume the role, as permitted by the management account
  administrator. The role has administrator permissions in the new member account. If you
  don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to OrganizationAccountAccessRole. For

  The pattern can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits with no spaces, and
  any of the following characters: =,.@-
- `"Tags"`: A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account. These tags
  are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, and not to the
  GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the actual GovCloud account, call the TagResource
  operation in the GovCloud region after the new GovCloud account exists. For each tag in the
  list, you must specify both a tag key and a value. You can set the value to an empty
  string, but you can't set it to null. For more information about tagging, see Tagging
  Organizations resources in the Organizations User Guide.  If any one of the tags is invalid
  or if you exceed the maximum allowed number of tags for an account, then the entire request

- `name`: The friendly name to assign to the new OU.
- `parent_id`: The unique identifier (ID) of the parent root or OU that you want to create
  the new OU in. The regex pattern for a parent ID string requires one of the following:
  Root - A string that begins with \"r-\" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or
  digits.    Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins with \"ou-\" followed by from 4
  to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is
  followed by a second \"-\" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Tags"`: A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created OU. For each tag in
  the list, you must specify both a tag key and a value. You can set the value to an empty
  string, but you can't set it to null. For more information about tagging, see Tagging
  Organizations resources in the Organizations User Guide.  If any one of the tags is invalid
  or if you exceed the allowed number of tags for an OU, then the entire request fails and
  the OU is not created.

    disable_awsservice_access(service_principal)
    disable_awsservice_access(service_principal, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Disables the integration of an Amazon Web Services service (the service that is specified
by ServicePrincipal) with Organizations. When you disable integration, the specified
service no longer can create a service-linked role in new accounts in your organization.
This means the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your
organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service
completes its clean-up from Organizations.  We  strongly recommend  that you don't use this
command to disable integration between Organizations and the specified Amazon Web Services
service. Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the specified service.
This lets the trusted service perform any required initialization when enabling trusted
access, such as creating any required resources and any required clean up of resources when
disabling trusted access.  For information about how to disable trusted service access to
your organization using the trusted service, see the Learn more link under the Supports
Trusted Access column at Amazon Web Services services that you can use with Organizations.
on this page. If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following actions
to occur:   The service can no longer create a service-linked role in the accounts in your
organization. This means that the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any
new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older
accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations.    The service can no
longer perform tasks in the member accounts in the organization, unless those operations
are explicitly permitted by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes
any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management account, or to a delegated
administrator account, where relevant.   Some services detect this and clean up any
remaining data or resources related to the integration, while other services stop accessing
the organization but leave any historical data and configuration in place to support a
possible re-enabling of the integration.   Using the other service's console or commands to
disable the integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any
resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its
resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see
the documentation for the other Amazon Web Services service.   After you perform the
DisableAWSServiceAccess operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations
in your organization's accounts  For more information about integrating other services with
Organizations, including the list of services that work with Organizations, see Integrating

other account's owner. The invitation is implemented as a Handshake whose details are in
the response.    You can invite Amazon Web Services accounts only from the same seller as
the management account. For example, if your organization's management account was created
by Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL), an Amazon Web Services seller in India, you
can invite only other AISPL accounts to your organization. You can't combine accounts from
AISPL and Amazon Web Services or from any other Amazon Web Services seller. For more
information, see Consolidated Billing in India.   If you receive an exception that
indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization or that the operation
failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again.
If the error persists after an hour, contact Amazon Web Services Support.    If the request
includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission. This
operation can be called only from the organization's management account.

# Arguments
- `target`: The identifier (ID) of the Amazon Web Services account that you want to invite
  to join your organization. This is a JSON object that contains the following elements:  {
  \"Type\": \"ACCOUNT\", \"Id\": \"&lt; account id number &gt;\" }  If you use the CLI, you
  can submit this as a single string, similar to the following example:  --target
  Id=123456789012,Type=ACCOUNT  If you specify \"Type\": \"ACCOUNT\", you must provide the
  Amazon Web Services account ID number as the Id. If you specify \"Type\": \"EMAIL\", you
  must specify the email address that is associated with the account.  --target
  Id=diego@example.com,Type=EMAIL

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Notes"`: Additional information that you want to include in the generated email to the
  recipient account owner.
- `"Tags"`: A list of tags that you want to attach to the account when it becomes a member

  when the request is made. The request is rejected if the tags in the request don't match
  the requirements of the policy at that time. Tag policy compliance is  not  checked again
  when the invitation is accepted and the tags are actually attached to the account. That
  means that if the tag policy changes between the invitation and the acceptance, then that
  tags could potentially be non-compliant.   If any one of the tags is invalid or if you
  exceed the allowed number of tags for an account, then the entire request fails and
  invitations are not sent.

    list_children(child_type, parent_id)
    list_children(child_type, parent_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Lists all of the organizational units (OUs) or accounts that are contained in the specified
parent OU or root. This operation, along with ListParents enables you to traverse the tree
structure that makes up this root.  Always check the NextToken response parameter for a
null value when calling a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return an
empty set of results even when there are more results available. The NextToken response
parameter value is null only when there are no more results to display.  This operation can
be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a
delegated administrator for an Amazon Web Services service.

# Arguments
- `child_type`: Filters the output to include only the specified child type.
- `parent_id`: The unique identifier (ID) for the parent root or OU whose children you want
  to list. The regex pattern for a parent ID string requires one of the following:    Root -
  A string that begins with \"r-\" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.
  Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins with \"ou-\" followed by from 4 to 32
  lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed
  by a second \"-\" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"MaxResults"`: The total number of results that you want included on each page of the
  response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to
  the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the NextToken
  response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the

NextToken response parameter value is null only when there are no more results to display.
This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member
account that is a delegated administrator for an Amazon Web Services service.  Policy types
can be enabled and disabled in roots. This is distinct from whether they're available in
the organization. When you enable all features, you make policy types available for use in
that organization. Individual policy types can then be enabled and disabled in a root. To
see the availability of a policy type in an organization, use DescribeOrganization.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"MaxResults"`: The total number of results that you want included on each page of the
  response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to
  the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the NextToken
  response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the
  NextToken request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the
  results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when
  there are more results available. You should check NextToken after every operation to
  ensure that you receive all of the results.
- `"NextToken"`: The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a NextToken
  response in a previous request. A NextToken response indicates that more output is
  available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's NextToken response to
  indicate where the output should continue from.

Removes the specified account from the organization. The removed account becomes a
standalone account that isn't a member of any organization. It's no longer subject to any
policies and is responsible for its own bill payments. The organization's management
account is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account after it's
removed from the organization. This operation can be called only from the organization's

 You can remove an account from your organization only if the account is configured with
the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in
an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
required of standalone accounts is not automatically collected. For an account that you
want to make standalone, you must choose a support plan, provide and verify the required
contact information, and provide a current payment method. Amazon Web Services uses the
payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) Amazon Web Services activity that
occurs while the account isn't attached to an organization. To remove an account that
doesn't yet have this information, you must sign in as the member account and follow the
steps at  To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been
