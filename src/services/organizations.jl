    AcceptHandshake()

Sends a response to the originator of a handshake agreeing to the action proposed by the handshake request.  This operation can be called only by the following principals when they also have the relevant IAM permissions:    Invitation to join or Approve all features request handshakes: only a principal from the member account.  The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the organizations:AcceptHandshake permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, the user must also have the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission so that AWS Organizations can create the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide.    Enable all features final confirmation handshake: only a principal from the master account. For more information about invitations, see Inviting an AWS Account to Join Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide. For more information about requests to enable all features in the organization, see Enabling All Features in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.    After you accept a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.

# Required Parameters
- `HandshakeId`: The unique identifier (ID) of the handshake that you want to accept. The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires \"h-\" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

    AttachPolicy()

Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual account. How the policy affects accounts depends on the type of policy. Refer to the AWS Organizations User Guide for information about each policy type:    AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY     BACKUP_POLICY     SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY     TAG_POLICY    This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.

# Required Parameters
- `PolicyId`: The unique identifier (ID) of the policy that you want to attach to the target. You can get the ID for the policy by calling the ListPolicies operation. The regex pattern for a policy ID string requires \"p-\" followed by from 8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, digits, or the underscore character (_).
- `TargetId`: The unique identifier (ID) of the root, OU, or account that you want to attach the policy to. You can get the ID by calling the ListRoots, ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent, or ListAccounts operations. The regex pattern for a target ID string requires one of the following:    Root - A string that begins with \"r-\" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.    Account - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.    Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins with \"ou-\" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that the OU is in).

    CancelHandshake()

Cancels a handshake. Canceling a handshake sets the handshake state to CANCELED.  This operation can be called only from the account that originated the handshake. The recipient of the handshake can't cancel it, but can use DeclineHandshake instead. After a handshake is canceled, the recipient can no longer respond to that handshake. After you cancel a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.

# Required Parameters

"""
    CreateAccount()

Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because CreateAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     The user who calls the API to create an account must have the organizations:CreateAccount permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide. AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default) that grants users in the master account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the master account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's master account. This operation can be called only from the organization's master account. For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is not automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at  To leave an organization as a member account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact AWS Support.   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact AWS Support.   Using CreateAccount to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see Closing an AWS Account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools. 

# Required Parameters
- `AccountName`: The friendly name of the member account.
- `Email`: The email address of the owner to assign to the new member account. This email address must not already be associated with another AWS account. You must use a valid email address to complete account creation. You can't access the root user of the account or remove an account that was created with an invalid email address.

# Optional Parameters
- `IamUserAccessToBilling`: If set to ALLOW, the new account enables IAM users to access account billing information if they have the required permissions. If set to DENY, only the root user of the new account can access account billing information. For more information, see Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide. If you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to ALLOW, and IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access billing information for the new account.
- `RoleName`: (Optional) The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically preconfigures in the new member account. This role trusts the master account, allowing users in the master account to assume the role, as permitted by the master account administrator. The role has administrator permissions in the new member account. If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to OrganizationAccountAccessRole.

    CreateGovCloudAccount()

This action is available if all of the following are true:   You're authorized to create accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. For more information on the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, see the  AWS GovCloud User Guide.    You already have an account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region that is associated with your master account in the commercial Region.    You call this action from the master account of your organization in the commercial Region.   You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission. AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide.    AWS automatically enables AWS CloudTrail for AWS GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:   Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.   Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage. For more information, see Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.    You call this action from the master account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the master account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see AWS Organizations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.  Calling CreateGovCloudAccount is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because CreateGovCloudAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress.

Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the master account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the master account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see AWS Organizations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.

You must use a valid email address to complete account creation. You can't access the root user of the account or remove an account that was created with an invalid email address. Like all request parameters for CreateGovCloudAccount, the request for the email address for the AWS GovCloud (US) account originates from the commercial Region, not from the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.

# Optional Parameters
- `IamUserAccessToBilling`: If set to ALLOW, the new linked account in the commercial Region enables IAM users to access account billing information if they have the required permissions. If set to DENY, only the root user of the new account can access account billing information.

    DetachPolicy()

Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or account.   If the policy being detached is a service control policy (SCP), the changes to permissions for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and roles in affected accounts are immediate.  Every root, OU, and account must have at least one SCP attached. If you want to replace the default FullAWSAccess policy with an SCP that limits the permissions that can be delegated, you must attach the replacement SCP before you can remove the default SCP. This is the authorization strategy of an \"allow list\". If you instead attach a second SCP and leave the FullAWSAccess SCP still attached, and specify \"Effect\": \"Deny\" in the second SCP to override the \"Effect\": \"Allow\" in the FullAWSAccess policy (or any other attached SCP), you're using the authorization strategy of a \"deny list\". This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.

    DisableAWSServiceAccess()

Disables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified by ServicePrincipal) with AWS Organizations. When you disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a service-linked role in new accounts in your organization. This means the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from AWS Organizations.   We recommend that you disable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service by using the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other AWS service.  After you perform the DisableAWSServiceAccess operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations in your organization's accounts unless the operations are explicitly permitted by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles.

    EnableAllFeatures()

Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies that can restrict the services and actions that can be called in each account.

    ListHandshakesForOrganization()

Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the requesting user is part of. The ListHandshakesForOrganization operation returns a list of handshake structures. Each structure contains details and status about a handshake. Handshakes that are ACCEPTED, DECLINED, or CANCELED appear in the results of this API for only 30 days after changing to that state.
