    create_classification_job(client_token, job_type, name, s3_job_definition)
    create_classification_job(client_token, job_type, name, s3_job_definition, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates and defines the settings for a classification job.

# Arguments
- `client_token`: A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the idempotency
  of the request.
- `job_type`: The schedule for running the job. Valid values are: ONE_TIME - Run the job
  only once. If you specify this value, don't specify a value for the scheduleFrequency
  property. SCHEDULED - Run the job on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. If you specify this
  value, use the scheduleFrequency property to define the recurrence pattern for the job.
- `name`: A custom name for the job. The name can contain as many as 500 characters.
- `s3_job_definition`: The S3 buckets that contain the objects to analyze, and the scope of
  that analysis.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"allowListIds"`: An array of unique identifiers, one for each allow list for the job to
  use when it analyzes data.
- `"customDataIdentifierIds"`: An array of unique identifiers, one for each custom data
  identifier for the job to use when it analyzes data. To use only managed data identifiers,
  don't specify a value for this property and specify a value other than NONE for the
  managedDataIdentifierSelector property.
- `"description"`: A custom description of the job. The description can contain as many as
  200 characters.
- `"initialRun"`: For a recurring job, specifies whether to analyze all existing, eligible
  objects immediately after the job is created (true). To analyze only those objects that are
  created or changed after you create the job and before the job's first scheduled run, set
  this value to false. If you configure the job to run only once, don't specify a value for
  this property.
- `"managedDataIdentifierIds"`: An array of unique identifiers, one for each managed data
  identifier for the job to include (use) or exclude (not use) when it analyzes data.
  Inclusion or exclusion depends on the managed data identifier selection type that you
  specify for the job (managedDataIdentifierSelector). To retrieve a list of valid values for
  this property, use the ListManagedDataIdentifiers operation.
- `"managedDataIdentifierSelector"`: The selection type to apply when determining which
  managed data identifiers the job uses to analyze data. Valid values are: ALL - Use all the
  managed data identifiers that Amazon Macie provides. If you specify this value, don't
  specify any values for the managedDataIdentifierIds property. EXCLUDE - Use all the managed
  data identifiers that Macie provides except the managed data identifiers specified by the
  managedDataIdentifierIds property. INCLUDE - Use only the managed data identifiers
  specified by the managedDataIdentifierIds property. NONE - Don't use any managed data
  identifiers. If you specify this value, specify at least one custom data identifier for the
  job (customDataIdentifierIds) and don't specify any values for the managedDataIdentifierIds
  property. If you don't specify a value for this property, the job uses all managed data
  identifiers. If you don't specify a value for this property or you specify ALL or EXCLUDE
  for a recurring job, the job also uses new managed data identifiers as they are released.
- `"samplingPercentage"`: The sampling depth, as a percentage, for the job to apply when
  processing objects. This value determines the percentage of eligible objects that the job
  analyzes. If this value is less than 100, Amazon Macie selects the objects to analyze at
  random, up to the specified percentage, and analyzes all the data in those objects.
- `"scheduleFrequency"`: The recurrence pattern for running the job. To run the job only
  once, don't specify a value for this property and set the value for the jobType property to
  ONE_TIME.
- `"tags"`: A map of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to associate with the job. A
  job can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a tag key and an associated tag
  value. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The maximum length of a tag value
  is 256 characters.

    create_custom_data_identifier(name, regex)
    create_custom_data_identifier(name, regex, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates and defines the criteria and other settings for a custom data identifier.

# Arguments
- `name`: A custom name for the custom data identifier. The name can contain as many as 128
  characters. We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in the name
  of a custom data identifier. Other users of your account might be able to see this name,
  depending on the actions that they're allowed to perform in Amazon Macie.
- `regex`: The regular expression (regex) that defines the pattern to match. The expression
  can contain as many as 512 characters.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientToken"`: A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the
  idempotency of the request.
- `"description"`: A custom description of the custom data identifier. The description can
  contain as many as 512 characters. We strongly recommend that you avoid including any
  sensitive data in the description of a custom data identifier. Other users of your account
  might be able to see this description, depending on the actions that they're allowed to
  perform in Amazon Macie.
- `"ignoreWords"`: An array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words) to
  exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expression contains any string
  in this array, Amazon Macie ignores it. The array can contain as many as 10 ignore words.
  Each ignore word can contain 4-90 UTF-8 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.
- `"keywords"`: An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords), one of which
  must precede and be within proximity (maximumMatchDistance) of the regular expression to
  match. The array can contain as many as 50 keywords. Each keyword can contain 3-90 UTF-8
  characters. Keywords aren't case sensitive.
- `"maximumMatchDistance"`: The maximum number of characters that can exist between the end
  of at least one complete character sequence specified by the keywords array and the end of
  the text that matches the regex pattern. If a complete keyword precedes all the text that
  matches the pattern and the keyword is within the specified distance, Amazon Macie includes
  the result. The distance can be 1-300 characters. The default value is 50.
- `"severityLevels"`: The severity to assign to findings that the custom data identifier
  produces, based on the number of occurrences of text that matches the custom data
  identifier's detection criteria. You can specify as many as three SeverityLevel objects in
  this array, one for each severity: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you specify more than one, the
  occurrences thresholds must be in ascending order by severity, moving from LOW to HIGH. For
  example, 1 for LOW, 50 for MEDIUM, and 100 for HIGH. If an S3 object contains fewer
  occurrences than the lowest specified threshold, Amazon Macie doesn't create a finding. If
  you don't specify any values for this array, Macie creates findings for S3 objects that
  contain at least one occurrence of text that matches the detection criteria, and Macie
  assigns the MEDIUM severity to those findings.
- `"tags"`: A map of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to associate with the custom
  data identifier. A custom data identifier can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists
  of a tag key and an associated tag value. The maximum length of a tag key is 128
  characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters.
