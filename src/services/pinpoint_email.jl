    create_configuration_set(configuration_set_name)
    create_configuration_set(configuration_set_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Create a configuration set. Configuration sets are groups of rules that you can apply to
the emails you send using Amazon Pinpoint. You apply a configuration set to an email by
including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply
a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to
the email.

# Arguments
- `configuration_set_name`: The name of the configuration set.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DeliveryOptions"`: An object that defines the dedicated IP pool that is used to send
  emails that you send using the configuration set.
- `"ReputationOptions"`: An object that defines whether or not Amazon Pinpoint collects
  reputation metrics for the emails that you send that use the configuration set.
- `"SendingOptions"`: An object that defines whether or not Amazon Pinpoint can send email
  that you send using the configuration set.
- `"Tags"`: An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that you want to
  associate with the configuration set.
- `"TrackingOptions"`: An object that defines the open and click tracking options for
  emails that you send using the configuration set.

Create an event destination. In Amazon Pinpoint, events include message sends, deliveries,
opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send
information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to
receive notifications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis
Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage. A single configuration set
can include more than one event destination.

# Arguments

  destination to.

Create a new pool of dedicated IP addresses. A pool can include one or more dedicated IP
addresses that are associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account. You can associate a pool
with a configuration set. When you send an email that uses that configuration set, Amazon
Pinpoint sends it using only the IP addresses in the associated pool.

# Arguments

    create_deliverability_test_report(content, from_email_address)
    create_deliverability_test_report(content, from_email_address, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you
predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When
you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains
the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon Pinpoint then sends that
message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about
24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport operation
to view the results of the test.

# Arguments
- `content`: The HTML body of the message that you sent when you performed the predictive
  inbox placement test.
- `from_email_address`: The email address that the predictive inbox placement test email
  was sent from.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

"""
    create_email_identity(email_identity)
    create_email_identity(email_identity, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Verifies an email identity for use with Amazon Pinpoint. In Amazon Pinpoint, an identity is
an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity
to send email with Amazon Pinpoint, you first have to verify it. By verifying an address,
you demonstrate that you're the owner of the address, and that you've given Amazon Pinpoint
permission to send email from the address. When you verify an email address, Amazon
Pinpoint sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you
follow the link in the verification email.  When you verify a domain, this operation
provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME
tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon
Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. It usually takes
around 72 hours to complete the domain verification process.

# Arguments
- `email_identity`: The email address or domain that you want to verify.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

identities that are verified as well as those that aren't.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"NextToken"`: A token returned from a previous call to ListEmailIdentities to indicate
  the position in the list of identities.
- `"PageSize"`: The number of results to show in a single call to ListEmailIdentities. If
  the number of results is larger than the number you specified in this parameter, then the
  response includes a NextToken element, which you can use to obtain additional results. The
  value you specify has to be at least 0, and can be no more than 1000.
