    CreateDashboard()

Creates a dashboard from a template. To first create a template, see the CreateTemplate API operation. A dashboard is an entity in QuickSight that identifies QuickSight reports, created from analyses. You can share QuickSight dashboards. With the right permissions, you can create scheduled email reports from them. The CreateDashboard, DescribeDashboard, and ListDashboardsByUser API operations act on the dashboard entity. If you have the correct permissions, you can create a dashboard from a template that exists in a different AWS account.

Required Parameters
{
  "AwsAccountId": "The ID of the AWS account where you want to create the dashboard.",
  "DashboardId": "The ID for the dashboard, also added to the IAM policy.",
  "Name": "The display name of the dashboard.",
  "SourceEntity": "The source entity from which the dashboard is created. The source entity accepts the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source template or analysis and also references the replacement datasets for the placeholders set when creating the template. The replacement datasets need to follow the same schema as the datasets for which placeholders were created when creating the template.  If you are creating a dashboard from a source entity in a different AWS account, use the ARN of the source template."
}

Optional Parameters

    TagResource()

Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified QuickSight resource.  Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the TagResource operation with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. QuickSight supports tagging on data set, data source, dashboard, and template.  Tagging for QuickSight works in a similar way to tagging for other AWS services, except for the following:   You can't use tags to track AWS costs for QuickSight. This restriction is because QuickSight costs are based on users and SPICE capacity, which aren't taggable resources.   QuickSight doesn't currently support the Tag Editor for AWS Resource Groups.  

Required Parameters
