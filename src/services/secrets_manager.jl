    cancel_rotate_secret(secret_id)
    cancel_rotate_secret(secret_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Turns off automatic rotation, and if a rotation is currently in progress, cancels the
rotation. If you cancel a rotation in progress, it can leave the VersionStage labels in an
unexpected state. You might need to remove the staging label AWSPENDING from the partially
created version. You also need to determine whether to roll back to the previous version of
the secret by moving the staging label AWSCURRENT to the version that has AWSPENDING. To
determine which version has a specific staging label, call ListSecretVersionIds. Then use
UpdateSecretVersionStage to change staging labels. For more information, see How rotation
works. To turn on automatic rotation again, call RotateSecret. Secrets Manager generates a
CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in
request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:  secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret.
For more information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and
access control in Secrets Manager.

# Arguments
- `secret_id`: The ARN or name of the secret. For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a
  complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN.

    create_secret(name)
    create_secret(name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new secret. A secret can be a password, a set of credentials such as a user name
and password, an OAuth token, or other secret information that you store in an encrypted
form in Secrets Manager. The secret also includes the connection information to access a
database or other service, which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets
Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to
manage the secret. For information about creating a secret in the console, see Create a
secret. To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the
SecretString parameter or the SecretBinary parameter, but not both. If you include
SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and
automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it. For database credentials you
want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the
JSON you store in the SecretString matches the JSON structure of a database secret. If you
don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed
key aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets
Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services
account automatically have access to use aws/secretsmanager. Creating aws/secretsmanager
can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. If the secret is in a
different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then you can't
use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must create and use a customer
managed KMS key.  Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this
action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except SecretBinary or
SecretString because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager
events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:  secretsmanager:CreateSecret. If you include
tags in the secret, you also need secretsmanager:TagResource. For more information, see
IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and access control in Secrets
Manager.  To encrypt the secret with a KMS key other than aws/secretsmanager, you need
kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permission to the key.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the new secret. The secret name can contain ASCII letters, numbers,
  and the following characters: /_+=.@- Do not end your secret name with a hyphen followed by
  six characters. If you do so, you risk confusion and unexpected results when searching for
  a secret by partial ARN. Secrets Manager automatically adds a hyphen and six random
  characters after the secret name at the end of the ARN.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AddReplicaRegions"`: A list of Regions and KMS keys to replicate secrets.
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: If you include SecretString or SecretBinary, then Secrets Manager
  creates an initial version for the secret, and this parameter specifies the unique
  identifier for the new version.   If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the
  Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty.
  The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this
  parameter in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request
  to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken
  yourself for the new version and include the value in the request.  This value helps ensure
  idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of
  duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that
  you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified
  secret.    If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the
  secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already
  exists and the version SecretString and SecretBinary values are the same as those in the
  request, then the request is ignored.   If a version with this value already exists and
  that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the
  request, then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing version. Instead, use
  PutSecretValue to create a new version.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new
  version.
- `"Description"`: The description of the secret.
- `"ForceOverwriteReplicaSecret"`: Specifies whether to overwrite a secret with the same
  name in the destination Region.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to
  encrypt the secret value in the secret. An alias is always prefixed by alias/, for example
  alias/aws/secretsmanager. For more information, see About aliases. To use a KMS key in a
  different account, use the key ARN or the alias ARN. If you don't specify this value, then
  Secrets Manager uses the key aws/secretsmanager. If that key doesn't yet exist, then
  Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it encrypts the secret
  value. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials
  calling the API, then you can't use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must
  create and use a customer managed KMS key.
- `"SecretBinary"`: The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.
  We recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents of the
  file as a parameter. Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both.
  This parameter is not available in the Secrets Manager console.
- `"SecretString"`: The text data to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret.
  We recommend you use a JSON structure of key/value pairs for your secret value. Either
  SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. If you create a secret by
  using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in
  only the SecretString parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a
  JSON structure of key/value pairs that a Lambda rotation function can parse.
- `"Tags"`: A list of tags to attach to the secret. Each tag is a key and value pair of
  strings in a JSON text string, for example:
  [{\"Key\":\"CostCenter\",\"Value\":\"12345\"},{\"Key\":\"environment\",\"Value\":\"productio
  n\"}]  Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key \"ABC\" is a
  different tag from one with key \"abc\". If you check tags in permissions policies as part
  of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the
  completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret,
  then Secrets Manager blocks the operation and returns an Access Denied error. For more
  information, see Control access to secrets using tags and Limit access to identities with
  tags that match secrets' tags. For information about how to format a JSON parameter for the
  various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters. If your command-line
  tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to
  avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. The following
  restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per secret: 50   Maximum key length:
  127 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length: 255 Unicode characters in UTF-8
  Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or
  values because Amazon Web Services reserves it for Amazon Web Services use. You can't edit
  or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
  your tags per secret limit.   If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and
  resources, other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed
  characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special
  characters: + - = . _ : / @.

"""
    delete_secret(secret_id)
    delete_secret(secret_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deletes a secret and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery window during which
you can restore the secret. The minimum recovery window is 7 days. The default recovery
window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a DeletionDate stamp to the secret that
specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets
Manager deletes the secret permanently. You can't delete a primary secret that is
replicated to other Regions. You must first delete the replicas using
RemoveRegionsFromReplication, and then delete the primary secret. When you delete a
replica, it is deleted immediately. You can't directly delete a version of a secret.
Instead, you remove all staging labels from the version using UpdateSecretVersionStage.
This marks the version as deprecated, and then Secrets Manager can automatically delete the
version in the background. To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can
create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to alert you to any attempts to access a secret during
the recovery window. For more information, see  Monitor secrets scheduled for deletion.
Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as
a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the
recovery window for the permanent delete to occur. At any time before recovery window ends,
you can use RestoreSecret to remove the DeletionDate and cancel the deletion of the secret.
When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret value. You must
first cancel the deletion with RestoreSecret and then you can retrieve the secret. Secrets
Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include
sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more
information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:
secretsmanager:DeleteSecret. For more information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets
Manager and Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager.

# Arguments
- `secret_id`: The ARN or name of the secret to delete. For an ARN, we recommend that you
  specify a complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery"`: Specifies whether to delete the secret without any
  recovery window. You can't use both this parameter and RecoveryWindowInDays in the same
  call. If you don't use either, then Secrets Manager defaults to a 30 day recovery window.
  Secrets Manager performs the actual deletion with an asynchronous background process, so
  there might be a short delay before the secret is permanently deleted. If you delete a
  secret and then immediately create a secret with the same name, use appropriate back off
  and retry logic.  Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to
  skip the normal recovery window before the permanent deletion that Secrets Manager would
  normally impose with the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter. If you delete a secret with the
  ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret.
  You lose the secret permanently.
- `"RecoveryWindowInDays"`: The number of days from 7 to 30 that Secrets Manager waits
  before permanently deleting the secret. You can't use both this parameter and
  ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery in the same call. If you don't use either, then Secrets Manager
  defaults to a 30 day recovery window.

    put_secret_value(secret_id)
    put_secret_value(secret_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it to the secret. The
version can contain a new SecretString value or a new SecretBinary value.  We recommend you
avoid calling PutSecretValue at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When
you update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets
Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove
versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you call PutSecretValue more than once every 10
minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the
quota for secret versions. You can specify the staging labels to attach to the new version
in VersionStages. If you don't include VersionStages, then Secrets Manager automatically
moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to this version. If this operation creates the first
version for the secret, then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label
AWSCURRENT to it. If this operation moves the staging label AWSCURRENT from another version
to this version, then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label
AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from. This operation is idempotent.
If you call this operation with a ClientRequestToken that matches an existing version's
VersionId, and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing.
However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you can't modify
an existing version; you can only create new ones. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail
log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request
parameters except SecretBinary or SecretString because it might be logged. For more
information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:
secretsmanager:PutSecretValue. For more information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets
Manager and Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager.

# Arguments
- `secret_id`: The ARN or name of the secret to add a new version to. For an ARN, we
  recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See Finding a secret
  from a partial ARN. If the secret doesn't already exist, use CreateSecret instead.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for the new version of the secret.   If you
  use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this
  operation, then you can leave this parameter empty because they generate a random UUID for
  you. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets
  Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for new
  versions and include that value in the request.   This value helps ensure idempotency.
  Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if
  there are failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function processing. We recommend
  that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.    If
  the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a
  new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and
  that version's SecretString or SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request
  then the request is ignored. The operation is idempotent.    If a version with this value
  already exists and the version of the SecretString and SecretBinary values are different
  from those in the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a secret
  version. You can only create new versions to store new secret values.   This value becomes
  the VersionId of the new version.
- `"SecretBinary"`: The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.
  To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary
  data in a file and then pass the contents of the file as a parameter.  You must include
  SecretBinary or SecretString, but not both. You can't access this value from the Secrets
  Manager console.
- `"SecretString"`: The text to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.  You
  must include SecretBinary or SecretString, but not both. We recommend you create the secret
  string as JSON key/value pairs, as shown in the example.
- `"VersionStages"`: A list of staging labels to attach to this version of the secret.
  Secrets Manager uses staging labels to track versions of a secret through the rotation
  process. If you specify a staging label that's already associated with a different version
  of the same secret, then Secrets Manager removes the label from the other version and
  attaches it to this version. If you specify AWSCURRENT, and it is already attached to
  another version, then Secrets Manager also moves the staging label AWSPREVIOUS to the
  version that AWSCURRENT was removed from. If you don't include VersionStages, then Secrets
  Manager automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to this version.

    rotate_secret(secret_id)
    rotate_secret(secret_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating the secret. For more information
about rotation, see Rotate secrets. If you include the configuration parameters, the
operation sets the values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you
don't include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values
already stored in the secret.  For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets
Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the secret value is in the
JSON structure of a database secret. In particular, if you want to use the  alternating
users strategy, your secret must contain the ARN of a superuser secret. To configure
rotation, you also need the ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function and the schedule
for the rotation. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and
creates or updates the credentials on the database or service to match. After testing the
new credentials, the function marks the new secret version with the staging label
AWSCURRENT. Then anyone who retrieves the secret gets the new version. For more
information, see How rotation works. You can create the Lambda rotation function based on
the rotation function templates that Secrets Manager provides. Choose a template that
matches your Rotation strategy. When rotation is successful, the AWSPENDING staging label
might be attached to the same version as the AWSCURRENT version, or it might not be
attached to any version. If the AWSPENDING staging label is present but not attached to the
same version as AWSCURRENT, then any later invocation of RotateSecret assumes that a
previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error. When rotation is
unsuccessful, the AWSPENDING staging label might be attached to an empty secret version.
For more information, see Troubleshoot rotation in the Secrets Manager User Guide. Secrets
Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include
sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more
information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:

Manager and Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager. You also need
lambda:InvokeFunction permissions on the rotation function. For more information, see
Permissions for rotation.

# Arguments
- `secret_id`: The ARN or name of the secret to rotate. For an ARN, we recommend that you
  specify a complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: A unique identifier for the new version of the secret that helps
  ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of
  duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during rotation. This value becomes
  the VersionId of the new version. If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the
  Amazon Web Services SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty.
  The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request for this
  parameter. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets
  Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for new
  versions and include that value in the request. You only need to specify this value if you
  implement your own retry logic and you want to ensure that Secrets Manager doesn't attempt
  to create a secret version twice. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to
  ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.
- `"RotateImmediately"`: Specifies whether to rotate the secret immediately or wait until
  the next scheduled rotation window. The rotation schedule is defined in
  RotateSecretRequestRotationRules. If you don't immediately rotate the secret, Secrets
  Manager tests the rotation configuration by running the  testSecret step of the Lambda
  rotation function. The test creates an AWSPENDING version of the secret and then removes
  it. If you don't specify this value, then by default, Secrets Manager rotates the secret
  immediately.
- `"RotationLambdaARN"`: The ARN of the Lambda rotation function that can rotate the secret.

    update_secret(secret_id)
    update_secret(secret_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Modifies the details of a secret, including metadata and the secret value. To change the
secret value, you can also use PutSecretValue. To change the rotation configuration of a
secret, use RotateSecret instead. We recommend you avoid calling UpdateSecret at a
sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When you call UpdateSecret to update the
secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager removes
outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created
less than 24 hours ago. If you update the secret value more than once every 10 minutes, you
create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret
versions. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary to create a new secret version,
Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to the new version. Then
it attaches the label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from. If you
call this operation with a ClientRequestToken that matches an existing version's VersionId,
the operation results in an error. You can't modify an existing version, you can only
create a new version. To remove a version, remove all staging labels from it. See
UpdateSecretVersionStage. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call
this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except SecretBinary
or SecretString because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets
Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:  secretsmanager:UpdateSecret. For
more information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and access
control in Secrets Manager. If you use a customer managed key, you must also have
kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions on the key. For more information, see
Secret encryption and decryption.

# Arguments
- `secret_id`: The ARN or name of the secret. For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a
  complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ClientRequestToken"`: If you include SecretString or SecretBinary, then Secrets Manager
  creates a new version for the secret, and this parameter specifies the unique identifier
  for the new version.  If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web
  Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or
  SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the
  request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets
  Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for the new
  version and include the value in the request.  This value becomes the VersionId of the new
  version.
- `"Description"`: The description of the secret.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to
  encrypt new secret versions as well as any existing versions with the staging labels
  AWSCURRENT, AWSPENDING, or AWSPREVIOUS. For more information about versions and staging
  labels, see Concepts: Version. A key alias is always prefixed by alias/, for example
  alias/aws/secretsmanager. For more information, see About aliases. If you set this to an
  empty string, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager.
  If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you
  automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have
  access to use aws/secretsmanager. Creating aws/secretsmanager can result in a one-time
  significant delay in returning the result.   You can only use the Amazon Web Services
  managed key aws/secretsmanager if you call this operation using credentials from the same
  Amazon Web Services account that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account,
  then you must use a customer managed key and provide the ARN of that KMS key in this field.
  The user making the call must have permissions to both the secret and the KMS key in their
  respective accounts.
- `"SecretBinary"`: The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.
  We recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents of the
  file as a parameter.  Either SecretBinary or SecretString must have a value, but not both.
  You can't access this parameter in the Secrets Manager console.
- `"SecretString"`: The text data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. We
  recommend you use a JSON structure of key/value pairs for your secret value.  Either
  SecretBinary or SecretString must have a value, but not both.

    update_secret_version_stage(secret_id, version_stage)
    update_secret_version_stage(secret_id, version_stage, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Secrets Manager uses staging
labels to track a version as it progresses through the secret rotation process. Each
staging label can be attached to only one version at a time. To add a staging label to a
version when it is already attached to another version, Secrets Manager first removes it
from the other version first and then attaches it to this one. For more information about
versions and staging labels, see Concepts: Version.  The staging labels that you specify in
the VersionStage parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels for the
version.  You can move the AWSCURRENT staging label to this version by including it in this
call.  Whenever you move AWSCURRENT, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label
AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.  If this action results in the
last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated'
and can be deleted by Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry
when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters
because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with
CloudTrail.  Required permissions:  secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage. For more
information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and access
control in Secrets Manager.

# Arguments
- `secret_id`: The ARN or the name of the secret with the version and staging labelsto
  modify. For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a partial ARN.
  See Finding a secret from a partial ARN.
- `version_stage`: The staging label to add to this version.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"MoveToVersionId"`: The ID of the version to add the staging label to. To remove a label
  from a version, then do not specify this parameter. If the staging label is already
  attached to a different version of the secret, then you must also specify the
  RemoveFromVersionId parameter.
- `"RemoveFromVersionId"`: The ID of the version that the staging label is to be removed
  from. If the staging label you are trying to attach to one version is already attached to a
  different version, then you must include this parameter and specify the version that the
  label is to be removed from. If the label is attached and you either do not specify this
  parameter, or the version ID does not match, then the operation fails.

    validate_resource_policy(resource_policy, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Validates that a resource policy does not grant a wide range of principals access to your
secret. A resource-based policy is optional for secrets. The API performs three checks when
validating the policy:   Sends a call to Zelkova, an automated reasoning engine, to ensure
your resource policy does not allow broad access to your secret, for example policies that
use a wildcard for the principal.   Checks for correct syntax in a policy.   Verifies the
policy does not lock out a caller.   Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when
you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it
might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail.
Required permissions:  secretsmanager:ValidateResourcePolicy. For more information, see
IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and access control in Secrets
Manager.

# Arguments
- `resource_policy`: A JSON-formatted string that contains an Amazon Web Services
  resource-based policy. The policy in the string identifies who can access or manage this
  secret and its versions. For example policies, see Permissions policy examples.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
