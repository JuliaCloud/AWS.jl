    CancelRotateSecret()

Disables automatic scheduled rotation and cancels the rotation of a secret if currently in progress. To re-enable scheduled rotation, call RotateSecret with AutomaticallyRotateAfterDays set to a value greater than 0. This immediately rotates your secret and then enables the automatic schedule.  If you cancel a rotation while in progress, it can leave the VersionStage labels in an unexpected state. Depending on the step of the rotation in progress, you might need to remove the staging label AWSPENDING from the partially created version, specified by the VersionId response value. You should also evaluate the partially rotated new version to see if it should be deleted, which you can do by removing all staging labels from the new version VersionStage field.  To successfully start a rotation, the staging label AWSPENDING must be in one of the following states:   Not attached to any version at all   Attached to the same version as the staging label AWSCURRENT    If the staging label AWSPENDING attached to a different version than the version with AWSCURRENT then the attempt to rotate fails.  Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret    Related operations    To configure rotation for a secret or to manually trigger a rotation, use RotateSecret.   To get the rotation configuration details for a secret, use DescribeSecret.   To list all of the currently available secrets, use ListSecrets.   To list all of the versions currently associated with a secret, use ListSecretVersionIds.  

# Required Parameters
- `SecretId`: Specifies the secret to cancel a rotation request. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.  If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters. If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you must not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a ResourceNotFoundException or an AccessDeniedException error, depending on your permissions.

    CreateSecret()

Creates a new secret. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of \"versions\" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more \"staging labels\" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The SecretVersionsToStages field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and not included in the list. You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the SecretString parameter or binary data in the SecretBinary parameter, but not both. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to the new version.    If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the SecretString or SecretBinary for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.   If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the KMSKeyId. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt SecretString or SecretBinary using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.       Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:CreateSecret   kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account default AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager.   kms:Decrypt - needed only if you use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account default AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager.   secretsmanager:TagResource - needed only if you include the Tags parameter.     Related operations    To delete a secret, use DeleteSecret.   To modify an existing secret, use UpdateSecret.   To create a new version of a secret, use PutSecretValue.   To retrieve the encrypted secure string and secure binary values, use GetSecretValue.   To retrieve all other details for a secret, use DescribeSecret. This does not include the encrypted secure string and secure binary values.   To retrieve the list of secret versions associated with the current secret, use DescribeSecret and examine the SecretVersionsToStages response value.  

# Required Parameters
- `Name`: Specifies the friendly name of the new secret. The secret name must be ASCII letters, digits, or the following characters : /_+=.@-  Do not end your secret name with a hyphen followed by six characters. If you do so, you risk confusion and unexpected results when searching for a secret by partial ARN. Secrets Manager automatically adds a hyphen and six random characters at the end of the ARN. 

# Optional Parameters
- `ClientRequestToken`: (Optional) If you include SecretString or SecretBinary, then an initial version is created as part of the secret, and this parameter specifies a unique identifier for the new version.   If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for the new version and include the value in the request.  This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.    If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and the version SecretString and SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request, then the request is ignored.   If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing version. Instead, use PutSecretValue to create a new version.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.
- `Description`: (Optional) Specifies a user-provided description of the secret.
- `KmsKeyId`: (Optional) Specifies the ARN, Key ID, or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the SecretString or SecretBinary values in the versions stored in this secret. You can specify any of the supported ways to identify a AWS KMS key ID. If you need to reference a CMK in a different account, you can use only the key ARN or the alias ARN. If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager defaults to using the AWS account's default CMK (the one named aws/secretsmanager). If a AWS KMS CMK with that name doesn't yet exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it needs to encrypt a version's SecretString or SecretBinary fields.  You can use the account default CMK to encrypt and decrypt only if you call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns the secret. If the secret resides in a different account, then you must create a custom CMK and specify the ARN in this field.  
- `SecretBinary`: (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty. This parameter is not available using the Secrets Manager console. It can be accessed only by using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.
- `SecretString`: (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret. Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty. If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the SecretString parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the Lambda rotation function knows how to parse. For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters in the AWS CLI User Guide. For example:  {\"username\":\"bob\",\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. 
- `Tags`: (Optional) Specifies a list of user-defined tags that are attached to the secret. Each tag is a \"Key\" and \"Value\" pair of strings. This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove tags, you must use UntagResource.    Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key \"ABC\" is a different tag from one with key \"abc\".   If you check tags in IAM policy Condition elements as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the successful completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then this operation is blocked and returns an Access Denied error.    This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters in the AWS CLI User Guide. For example:  [{\"Key\":\"CostCenter\",\"Value\":\"12345\"},{\"Key\":\"environment\",\"Value\":\"production\"}]  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.  The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per secret—50   Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because AWS reserves it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.   If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources, remember other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.

"""
    DeleteSecret()

Deletes an entire secret and all of its versions. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a DeletionDate stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently. At any time before recovery window ends, you can use RestoreSecret to remove the DeletionDate and cancel the deletion of the secret. You cannot access the encrypted secret information in any secret that is scheduled for deletion. If you need to access that information, you must cancel the deletion with RestoreSecret and then retrieve the information.    There is no explicit operation to delete a version of a secret. Instead, remove all staging labels from the VersionStage field of a version. That marks the version as deprecated and allows Secrets Manager to delete it as needed. Versions that do not have any staging labels do not show up in ListSecretVersionIds unless you specify IncludeDeprecated.   The permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period is performed as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the actual delete operation to occur.     Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:DeleteSecret    Related operations    To create a secret, use CreateSecret.   To cancel deletion of a version of a secret before the recovery window has expired, use RestoreSecret.  

# Required Parameters
- `SecretId`: Specifies the secret that you want to delete. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.  If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret.

If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a ResourceNotFoundException or an AccessDeniedException error, depending on your permissions. 

# Optional Parameters
- `ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery`: (Optional) Specifies that the secret is to be deleted without any recovery window. You can't use both this parameter and the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter in the same API call. An asynchronous background process performs the actual deletion, so there can be a short delay before the operation completes. If you write code to delete and then immediately recreate a secret with the same name, ensure that your code includes appropriate back off and retry logic.  Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal waiting period before the permanent deletion that AWS would normally impose with the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter. If you delete a secret with the ForceDeleteWithouRecovery parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. It is permanently lost. 
- `RecoveryWindowInDays`: (Optional) Specifies the number of days that Secrets Manager waits before it can delete the secret. You can't use both this parameter and the ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery parameter in the same API call. This value can range from 7 to 30 days. The default value is 30.

When this happens, the NextToken response parameter contains a value to pass to the next call to the same API to request the next part of the list.   Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:ListSecrets    Related operations    To list the versions attached to a secret, use ListSecretVersionIds.  

# Optional Parameters
- `Filters`: Lists the secret request filters.
- `MaxResults`: (Optional) Limits the number of results you want to include in the response. If you don't include this parameter, it defaults to a value that's specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the NextToken response element is present and has a value (isn't null). Include that value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Secrets Manager might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check NextToken after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
- `NextToken`: (Optional) Use this parameter in a request if you receive a NextToken response in a previous request indicating there's more output available. In a subsequent call, set it to the value of the previous call NextToken response to indicate where the output should continue from.
- `SortOrder`: Lists secrets in the requested order.

    PutResourcePolicy()

Attaches the contents of the specified resource-based permission policy to a secret. A resource-based policy is optional. Alternatively, you can use IAM identity-based policies that specify the secret's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the policy statement's Resources element. You can also use a combination of both identity-based and resource-based policies. The affected users and roles receive the permissions that are permitted by all of the relevant policies. For more information, see Using Resource-Based Policies for AWS Secrets Manager. For the complete description of the AWS policy syntax and grammar, see IAM JSON Policy Reference in the IAM User Guide.  Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:PutResourcePolicy    Related operations    To retrieve the resource policy attached to a secret, use GetResourcePolicy.   To delete the resource-based policy that's attached to a secret, use DeleteResourcePolicy.   To list all of the currently available secrets, use ListSecrets.  

# Required Parameters
- `ResourcePolicy`: A JSON-formatted string that's constructed according to the grammar and syntax for an AWS resource-based policy. The policy in the string identifies who can access or manage this secret and its versions. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters in the AWS CLI User Guide.
- `SecretId`: Specifies the secret that you want to attach the resource-based policy to. You can specify either the ARN or the friendly name of the secret.  If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters. If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you must not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a ResourceNotFoundException or an AccessDeniedException error, depending on your permissions. 

# Optional Parameters
- `BlockPublicPolicy`: Makes an optional API call to Zelkova to validate the Resource Policy to prevent broad access to your secret.

"""
    PutSecretValue()

Stores a new encrypted secret value in the specified secret. To do this, the operation creates a new version and attaches it to the secret. The version can contain a new SecretString value or a new SecretBinary value. You can also specify the staging labels that are initially attached to the new version.  The Secrets Manager console uses only the SecretString field. To add binary data to a secret with the SecretBinary field you must use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.    If this operation creates the first version for the secret then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to the new version.   If another version of this secret already exists, then this operation does not automatically move any staging labels other than those that you explicitly specify in the VersionStages parameter.   If this operation moves the staging label AWSCURRENT from another version to this version (because you included it in the StagingLabels parameter) then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.   This operation is idempotent. If a version with a VersionId with the same value as the ClientRequestToken parameter already exists and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you cannot modify an existing version; you can only create new ones.      If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the SecretString or SecretBinary for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.   If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the KMSKeyId. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt SecretString or SecretBinary using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.     Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:PutSecretValue   kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account's default AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager.    Related operations    To retrieve the encrypted value you store in the version of a secret, use GetSecretValue.   To create a secret, use CreateSecret.   To get the details for a secret, use DescribeSecret.   To list the versions attached to a secret, use ListSecretVersionIds.  

# Required Parameters
- `SecretId`: Specifies the secret to which you want to add a new version. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret. The secret must already exist.  If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters. If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you must not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a ResourceNotFoundException or an AccessDeniedException error, depending on your permissions. 

# Optional Parameters
- `ClientRequestToken`: (Optional) Specifies a unique identifier for the new version of the secret.   If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for new versions and include that value in the request.   This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function's processing. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.    If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString or SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent).    If a version with this value already exists and the version of the SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing secret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret values.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.
- `SecretBinary`: (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either SecretBinary or SecretString must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty. This parameter is not accessible if the secret using the Secrets Manager console. 
- `SecretString`: (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret. Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty. If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the SecretString parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default Lambda rotation function knows how to parse. For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters in the AWS CLI User Guide.  For example:  [{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.
- `VersionStages`: (Optional) Specifies a list of staging labels that are attached to this version of the secret. These staging labels are used to track the versions through the rotation process by the Lambda rotation function. A staging label must be unique to a single version of the secret. If you specify a staging label that's already associated with a different version of the same secret then that staging label is automatically removed from the other version and attached to this version. If you do not specify a value for VersionStages then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to this new version.

    RotateSecret()

Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating this secret. If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets those values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you do not include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret. After the rotation completes, the protected service and its clients all use the new version of the secret.  This required configuration information includes the ARN of an AWS Lambda function and the time between scheduled rotations. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the protected service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret with the staging label AWSCURRENT so that your clients all immediately begin to use the new version. For more information about rotating secrets and how to configure a Lambda function to rotate the secrets for your protected service, see Rotating Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one completes. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load. The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one of two states:   The AWSPENDING and AWSCURRENT staging labels are attached to the same version of the secret, or   The AWSPENDING staging label is not attached to any version of the secret.   If the AWSPENDING staging label is present but not attached to the same version as AWSCURRENT then any later invocation of RotateSecret assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error.  Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:RotateSecret   lambda:InvokeFunction (on the function specified in the secret's metadata)    Related operations    To list the secrets in your account, use ListSecrets.   To get the details for a version of a secret, use DescribeSecret.   To create a new version of a secret, use CreateSecret.   To attach staging labels to or remove staging labels from a version of a secret, use UpdateSecretVersionStage.  

# Required Parameters
- `SecretId`: Specifies the secret that you want to rotate. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.  If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret.

If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a ResourceNotFoundException or an AccessDeniedException error, depending on your permissions. 

# Optional Parameters
- `ClientRequestToken`: (Optional) Specifies a unique identifier for the new version of the secret that helps ensure idempotency.

    TagResource()

Attaches one or more tags, each consisting of a key name and a value, to the specified secret. Tags are part of the secret's overall metadata, and are not associated with any specific version of the secret. This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove tags, you must use UntagResource. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per secret—50   Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because AWS reserves it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.   If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources, remember other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.    If you use tags as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If successfully completing this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then the operation is blocked and returns an Access Denied error.

- `Description`: (Optional) Specifies an updated user-provided description of the secret.
- `KmsKeyId`: (Optional) Specifies an updated ARN or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the protected text in new versions of this secret.  You can only use the account's default CMK to encrypt and decrypt if you call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then you must create a custom CMK and provide the ARN of that CMK in this field. The user making the call must have permissions to both the secret and the CMK in their respective accounts. 
- `SecretBinary`: (Optional) Specifies updated binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either SecretBinary or SecretString must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty. This parameter is not accessible using the Secrets Manager console.
- `SecretString`: (Optional) Specifies updated text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret. Either SecretBinary or SecretString must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty. If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the SecretString parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default Lambda rotation function knows how to parse. For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters in the AWS CLI User Guide. For example:  [{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. You can also 'escape' the double quote character in the embedded JSON text by prefacing each with a backslash. For example, the following string is surrounded by double-quotes. All of the embedded double quotes are escaped:  \"[{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]\"

    UpdateSecretVersionStage()

Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Staging labels are used to track a version as it progresses through the secret rotation process. You can attach a staging label to only one version of a secret at a time. If a staging label to be added is already attached to another version, then it is moved--removed from the other version first and then attached to this one. For more information about staging labels, see Staging Labels in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.  The staging labels that you specify in the VersionStage parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels--they don't replace it. You can move the AWSCURRENT staging label to this version by including it in this call.  Whenever you move AWSCURRENT, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.  If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.  Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage    Related operations    To get the list of staging labels that are currently associated with a version of a secret, use  DescribeSecret  and examine the SecretVersionsToStages response value.   

# Required Parameters
- `SecretId`: Specifies the secret with the version with the list of staging labels you want to modify. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.  If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters. If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you must not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a ResourceNotFoundException or an AccessDeniedException error, depending on your permissions. 
- `VersionStage`: The staging label to add to this version.

# Optional Parameters
- `MoveToVersionId`: (Optional) The secret version ID that you want to add the staging label. If you want to remove a label from a version, then do not specify this parameter. If the staging label is already attached to a different version of the secret, then you must also specify the RemoveFromVersionId parameter. 
- `RemoveFromVersionId`: Specifies the secret version ID of the version that the staging label is to be removed from. If the staging label you are trying to attach to one version is already attached to a different version, then you must include this parameter and specify the version that the label is to be removed from. If the label is attached and you either do not specify this parameter, or the version ID does not match, then the operation fails.

    ValidateResourcePolicy()

Validates the JSON text of the resource-based policy document attached to the specified secret. The JSON request string input and response output displays formatted code with white space and line breaks for better readability. Submit your input as a single line JSON string. A resource-based policy is optional.

# Required Parameters
- `ResourcePolicy`: Identifies the Resource Policy attached to the secret.
