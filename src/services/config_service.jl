ResultToken => An encrypted token that associates an evaluation with an AWS Config rule. Identifies the rule and the event that triggered the evaluation.

Optional Parameters
Evaluations => The assessments that the AWS Lambda function performs. Each evaluation identifies an AWS resource and indicates whether it complies with the AWS Config rule that invokes the AWS Lambda function.
TestMode => Use this parameter to specify a test run for PutEvaluations. You can verify whether your AWS Lambda function will deliver evaluation results to AWS Config. No updates occur to your existing evaluations, and evaluation results are not sent to AWS Config.  When TestMode is true, PutEvaluations doesn't require a valid value for the ResultToken parameter, but the value cannot be null.

    PutOrganizationConfigRule()

Adds or updates organization config rule for your entire organization evaluating whether your AWS resources comply with your desired configurations.  Only a master account and a delegated administrator can create or update an organization config rule. When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure AWS Organizations ListDelegatedAdministrator permissions are added.  This API enables organization service access through the EnableAWSServiceAccess action and creates a service linked role AWSServiceRoleForConfigMultiAccountSetup in the master or delegated administrator account of your organization. The service linked role is created only when the role does not exist in the caller account. AWS Config verifies the existence of role with GetRole action. To use this API with delegated administrator, register a delegated administrator by calling AWS Organization register-delegated-administrator for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com.  You can use this action to create both custom AWS Config rules and AWS managed Config rules. If you are adding a new custom AWS Config rule, you must first create AWS Lambda function in the master account or a delegated administrator that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use the PutOrganizationConfigRule action to add the rule to AWS Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that AWS Lambda assigns to the function. If you are adding an AWS managed Config rule, specify the rule's identifier for the RuleIdentifier key. The maximum number of organization config rules that AWS Config supports is 150 and 3 delegated administrator per organization.   Prerequisite: Ensure you call EnableAllFeatures API to enable all features in an organization. Specify either OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata or OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata. 

Required Parameters
OrganizationConfigRuleName => The name that you assign to an organization config rule.

Optional Parameters
ExcludedAccounts => A comma-separated list of accounts that you want to exclude from an organization config rule.
OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata => An OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata object.
OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata => An OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata object.

    PutOrganizationConformancePack()

Deploys conformance packs across member accounts in an AWS Organization. Only a master account and a delegated administrator can call this API. When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure AWS Organizations ListDelegatedAdministrator permissions are added. This API enables organization service access for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com through the EnableAWSServiceAccess action and creates a service linked role AWSServiceRoleForConfigMultiAccountSetup in the master or delegated administrator account of your organization. The service linked role is created only when the role does not exist in the caller account. To use this API with delegated administrator, register a delegated administrator by calling AWS Organization register-delegate-admin for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com.  Prerequisite: Ensure you call EnableAllFeatures API to enable all features in an organization. You must specify either the TemplateS3Uri or the TemplateBody parameter, but not both. If you provide both AWS Config uses the TemplateS3Uri parameter and ignores the TemplateBody parameter. AWS Config sets the state of a conformance pack to CREATE_IN_PROGRESS and UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS until the conformance pack is created or updated. You cannot update a conformance pack while it is in this state. You can create 6 conformance packs with 25 AWS Config rules in each pack and 3 delegated administrator per organization.  

Required Parameters
DeliveryS3Bucket => Location of an Amazon S3 bucket where AWS Config can deliver evaluation results. AWS Config stores intermediate files while processing conformance pack template.  The delivery bucket name should start with awsconfigconforms. For example: "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your_bucket_name/*". For more information, see Permissions for cross account bucket access.
OrganizationConformancePackName => Name of the organization conformance pack you want to create.

Optional Parameters
ConformancePackInputParameters => A list of ConformancePackInputParameter objects.
DeliveryS3KeyPrefix => The prefix for the Amazon S3 bucket.
ExcludedAccounts => A list of AWS accounts to be excluded from an organization conformance pack while deploying a conformance pack.
TemplateBody => A string containing full conformance pack template body. Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes.

    StartConfigRulesEvaluation()

Runs an on-demand evaluation for the specified AWS Config rules against the last known configuration state of the resources. Use StartConfigRulesEvaluation when you want to test that a rule you updated is working as expected. StartConfigRulesEvaluation does not re-record the latest configuration state for your resources. It re-runs an evaluation against the last known state of your resources.  You can specify up to 25 AWS Config rules per request.  An existing StartConfigRulesEvaluation call for the specified rules must complete before you can call the API again. If you chose to have AWS Config stream to an Amazon SNS topic, you will receive a ConfigRuleEvaluationStarted notification when the evaluation starts.  You don't need to call the StartConfigRulesEvaluation API to run an evaluation for a new rule. When you create a rule, AWS Config evaluates your resources against the rule automatically.   The StartConfigRulesEvaluation API is useful if you want to run on-demand evaluations, such as the following example:   You have a custom rule that evaluates your IAM resources every 24 hours.   You update your Lambda function to add additional conditions to your rule.   Instead of waiting for the next periodic evaluation, you call the StartConfigRulesEvaluation API.   AWS Config invokes your Lambda function and evaluates your IAM resources.   Your custom rule will still run periodic evaluations every 24 hours.
