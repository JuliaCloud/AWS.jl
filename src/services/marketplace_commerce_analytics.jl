    generate_data_set(data_set_publication_date, data_set_type, destination_s3_bucket_name, role_name_arn, sns_topic_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Given a data set type and data set publication date, asynchronously publishes the requested
data set to the specified S3 bucket and notifies the specified SNS topic once the data is
available. Returns a unique request identifier that can be used to correlate requests with
notifications from the SNS topic. Data sets will be published in comma-separated values
(CSV) format with the file name {data_set_type}_YYYY-MM-DD.csv. If a file with the same
name already exists (e.g. if the same data set is requested twice), the original file will
be overwritten by the new file. Requires a Role with an attached permissions policy
providing Allow permissions for the following actions: s3:PutObject, s3:GetBucketLocation,
sns:GetTopicAttributes, sns:Publish, iam:GetRolePolicy.

# Arguments
- `data_set_publication_date`: The date a data set was published. For daily data sets,
  provide a date with day-level granularity for the desired day. For monthly data sets except
  those with prefix disbursed_amount, provide a date with month-level granularity for the
  desired month (the day value will be ignored). For data sets with prefix disbursed_amount,
  provide a date with day-level granularity for the desired day. For these data sets we will
  look backwards in time over the range of 31 days until the first data set is found (the
  latest one).
- `data_set_type`: The desired data set type.

- `destination_s3_bucket_name`: The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the destination S3
  bucket.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"customerDefinedValues"`: (Optional) Key-value pairs which will be returned, unmodified,
  in the Amazon SNS notification message and the data set metadata file. These key-value
  pairs can be used to correlated responses with tracking information from other systems.
- `"destinationS3Prefix"`: (Optional) The desired S3 prefix for the published data set,
  similar to a directory path in standard file systems. For example, if given the bucket name
  \"mybucket\" and the prefix \"myprefix/mydatasets\", the output file \"outputfile\" would
  be published to \"s3://mybucket/myprefix/mydatasets/outputfile\". If the prefix directory
  structure does not exist, it will be created. If no prefix is provided, the data set will
  be published to the S3 bucket root.

Given a data set type and a from date, asynchronously publishes the requested customer
support data to the specified S3 bucket and notifies the specified SNS topic once the data
is available. Returns a unique request identifier that can be used to correlate requests
with notifications from the SNS topic. Data sets will be published in comma-separated
values (CSV) format with the file name {data_set_type}_YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH-mm-ss'Z'.csv. If a
file with the same name already exists (e.g. if the same data set is requested twice), the
original file will be overwritten by the new file. Requires a Role with an attached
permissions policy providing Allow permissions for the following actions: s3:PutObject,
s3:GetBucketLocation, sns:GetTopicAttributes, sns:Publish, iam:GetRolePolicy.

# Arguments
- `data_set_type`:  Specifies the data set type to be written to the output csv file. The
  data set types customer_support_contacts_data and test_customer_support_contacts_data both
  result in a csv file containing the following fields: Product Id, Product Code, Customer
  Guid, Subscription Guid, Subscription Start Date, Organization, AWS Account Id, Given Name,
  Surname, Telephone Number, Email, Title, Country Code, ZIP Code, Operation Type, and
  Operation Time.    customer_support_contacts_data Customer support contact data. The data
  set will contain all changes (Creates, Updates, and Deletes) to customer support contact
  data from the date specified in the from_date parameter.
  test_customer_support_contacts_data An example data set containing static test data in the
  same format as customer_support_contacts_data
- `destination_s3_bucket_name`: The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the destination S3
  bucket.
- `from_date`: The start date from which to retrieve the data set in UTC. This parameter
  only affects the customer_support_contacts_data data set type.
- `role_name_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Role with an attached permissions
  policy to interact with the provided AWS services.
- `sns_topic_arn`: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the SNS Topic that will be notified when
  the data set has been published or if an error has occurred.

- `"destinationS3Prefix"`: (Optional) The desired S3 prefix for the published data set,
  similar to a directory path in standard file systems. For example, if given the bucket name
  \"mybucket\" and the prefix \"myprefix/mydatasets\", the output file \"outputfile\" would
  be published to \"s3://mybucket/myprefix/mydatasets/outputfile\". If the prefix directory
