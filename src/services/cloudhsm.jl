For information about the current version of AWS CloudHSM, see AWS CloudHSM, the AWS CloudHSM User Guide, and the AWS CloudHSM API Reference. Creates an uninitialized HSM instance. There is an upfront fee charged for each HSM instance that you create with the CreateHsm operation. If you accidentally provision an HSM and want to request a refund, delete the instance using the DeleteHsm operation, go to the AWS Support Center, create a new case, and select Account and Billing Support.  It can take up to 20 minutes to create and provision an HSM. You can monitor the status of the HSM with the DescribeHsm operation. The HSM is ready to be initialized when the status changes to RUNNING. 

# Required Parameters
- `IamRoleArn`: The ARN of an IAM role to enable the AWS CloudHSM service to allocate an ENI on your behalf.
- `SshKey`: The SSH public key to install on the HSM.
- `SubnetId`: The identifier of the subnet in your VPC in which to place the HSM.
- `SubscriptionType`: 

# Optional Parameters
- `ClientToken`: A user-defined token to ensure idempotence. Subsequent calls to this operation with the same token will be ignored.
- `EniIp`: The IP address to assign to the HSM's ENI. If an IP address is not specified, an IP address will be randomly chosen from the CIDR range of the subnet.
- `ExternalId`: The external ID from IamRoleArn, if present.
- `SyslogIp`: The IP address for the syslog monitoring server. The AWS CloudHSM service only supports one syslog monitoring server.
