    GetEffectivePermissionsForPath()

Returns the permissions for a specified table or database resource located at a path in Amazon S3.

Required Parameters
{
  "ResourceArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource for which you want to get permissions."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "MaxResults": "The maximum number of results to return.",
  "NextToken": "A continuation token, if this is not the first call to retrieve this list.",

    ListPermissions()

Returns a list of the principal permissions on the resource, filtered by the permissions of the caller. For example, if you are granted an ALTER permission, you are able to see only the principal permissions for ALTER. This operation returns only those permissions that have been explicitly granted. For information about permissions, see Security and Access Control to Metadata and Data.

Optional Parameters
{
  "MaxResults": "The maximum number of results to return.",
  "NextToken": "A continuation token, if this is not the first call to retrieve this list.",
  "ResourceType": "Specifies a resource type to filter the permissions returned.",
  "Resource": "A resource where you will get a list of the principal permissions. This operation does not support getting privileges on a table with columns. Instead, call this operation on the table, and the operation returns the table and the table w columns.",
  "Principal": "Specifies a principal to filter the permissions returned.",

"""
    RegisterResource()

Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog. To add or update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the chosen Amazon S3 path. Choose a role that you know has permission to do this, or choose the AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess service-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy.

Required Parameters
{
  "ResourceArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to register."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "UseServiceLinkedRole": "Designates a trusted caller, an IAM principal, by registering this caller with the Data Catalog. ",
  "RoleArn": "The identifier for the role."
}

"""
    GrantPermissions()

Grants permissions to the principal to access metadata in the Data Catalog and data organized in underlying data storage such as Amazon S3. For information about permissions, see Security and Access Control to Metadata and Data.

Required Parameters
{
  "Permissions": "The permissions granted to the principal on the resource. AWS Lake Formation defines privileges to grant and revoke access to metadata in the Data Catalog and data organized in underlying data storage such as Amazon S3.

Note that if you define a resource with a particular ARN, then later delete, and recreate a resource with that same ARN, the resource maintains the permissions already granted. "

Optional Parameters
{
