    CreateConfigurationSet()

Create a configuration set. Configuration sets are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send using Amazon Pinpoint. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email. 

Required Parameters
ConfigurationSetName => The name of the configuration set.

Optional Parameters
DeliveryOptions => An object that defines the dedicated IP pool that is used to send emails that you send using the configuration set.
ReputationOptions => An object that defines whether or not Amazon Pinpoint collects reputation metrics for the emails that you send that use the configuration set.
SendingOptions => An object that defines whether or not Amazon Pinpoint can send email that you send using the configuration set.

    CreateConfigurationSetEventDestination()

Create an event destination. In Amazon Pinpoint, events include message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage. A single configuration set can include more than one event destination.

"""
    CreateDeliverabilityTestReport()

Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon Pinpoint then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport operation to view the results of the test.

Required Parameters
Content => The HTML body of the message that you sent when you performed the predictive inbox placement test.
FromEmailAddress => The email address that the predictive inbox placement test email was sent from.

Optional Parameters

"""
    CreateEmailIdentity()

Verifies an email identity for use with Amazon Pinpoint. In Amazon Pinpoint, an identity is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email with Amazon Pinpoint, you first have to verify it. By verifying an address, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the address, and that you've given Amazon Pinpoint permission to send email from the address. When you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.  When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. It usually takes around 72 hours to complete the domain verification process.

Required Parameters
EmailIdentity => The email address or domain that you want to verify.

Optional Parameters
Tags => An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that you want to associate with the email identity.

"""
    PutEmailIdentityFeedbackAttributes()

Used to enable or disable feedback forwarding for an identity. This setting determines what happens when an identity is used to send an email that results in a bounce or complaint event. When you enable feedback forwarding, Amazon Pinpoint sends you email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. Amazon Pinpoint sends this notification to the address that you specified in the Return-Path header of the original email. When you disable feedback forwarding, Amazon Pinpoint sends notifications through other mechanisms, such as by notifying an Amazon SNS topic. You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).

Required Parameters
EmailIdentity => The email identity that you want to configure bounce and complaint feedback forwarding for.

Optional Parameters
EmailForwardingEnabled => Sets the feedback forwarding configuration for the identity. If the value is true, Amazon Pinpoint sends you email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. Amazon Pinpoint sends this notification to the address that you specified in the Return-Path header of the original email. When you set this value to false, Amazon Pinpoint sends notifications through other mechanisms, such as by notifying an Amazon SNS topic or another event destination. You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).

    PutEmailIdentityMailFromAttributes()

Used to enable or disable the custom Mail-From domain configuration for an email identity.

Required Parameters
EmailIdentity => The verified email identity that you want to set up the custom MAIL FROM domain for.

Optional Parameters
BehaviorOnMxFailure => The action that you want Amazon Pinpoint to take if it can't read the required MX record when you send an email. When you set this value to UseDefaultValue, Amazon Pinpoint uses amazonses.com as the MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to RejectMessage, Amazon Pinpoint returns a MailFromDomainNotVerified error, and doesn't attempt to deliver the email. These behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain configuration is in the Pending, Failed, and TemporaryFailure states.
MailFromDomain =>  The custom MAIL FROM domain that you want the verified identity to use. The MAIL FROM domain must meet the following criteria:   It has to be a subdomain of the verified identity.   It can't be used to receive email.   It can't be used in a "From" address if the MAIL FROM domain is a destination for feedback forwarding emails.

The message that you specify has to be a valid MIME message.  

Required Parameters
Content => An object that contains the body of the message. You can send either a Simple message or a Raw message.
Destination => An object that contains the recipients of the email message.

Optional Parameters
ConfigurationSetName => The name of the configuration set that you want to use when sending the email.
EmailTags => A list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an email that you send using the SendEmail operation. Tags correspond to characteristics of the email that you define, so that you can publish email sending events.

    TagResource()

Add one or more tags (keys and values) to a specified resource. A tag is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key.

Required Parameters
ResourceArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to add one or more tags to.
Tags => A list of the tags that you want to add to the resource. A tag consists of a required tag key (Key) and an associated tag value (Value). The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters.
