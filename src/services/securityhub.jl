# Required Parameters
- `FindingIdentifiers`: The list of findings to update. BatchUpdateFindings can be used to update up to 100 findings at a time. For each finding, the list provides the finding identifier and the ARN of the finding provider.

# Optional Parameters
- `Confidence`: The updated value for the finding confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue that it was intended to identify. Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confidence.
- `Criticality`: The updated value for the level of importance assigned to the resources associated with the findings. A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources. 
- `Note`: 
- `RelatedFindings`: A list of findings that are related to the updated findings.
- `Severity`: Used to update the finding severity.

    CreateMembers()

Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account used to make the request, which is the master account. If you are integrated with Organizations, then the master account is the Security Hub administrator account that is designated by the organization management account.  CreateMembers is always used to add accounts that are not organization members. For accounts that are part of an organization, CreateMembers is only used in the following cases:   Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new accounts in an organization.   The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.   This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the  EnableSecurityHub  operation. For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the  InviteMembers  operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub. Accounts that are part of an organization do not receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub. A permissions policy is added that permits the master account to view the findings generated in the member account. When Security Hub is enabled in a member account, findings are sent to both the member and master accounts.  To remove the association between the master and member accounts, use the  DisassociateFromMasterAccount  or  DisassociateMembers  operation.

# Required Parameters
- `AccountDetails`: The list of accounts to associate with the Security Hub master account. For each account, the list includes the account ID and optionally the email address.
