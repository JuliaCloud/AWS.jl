  update up to 100 findings at a time. For each finding, the list provides the finding
  identifier and the ARN of the finding provider.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Confidence"`: The updated value for the finding confidence. Confidence is defined as
  the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue that it was
  intended to identify. Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0
  means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confidence.
- `"Criticality"`: The updated value for the level of importance assigned to the resources
  associated with the findings. A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no
  criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.
- `"Note"`:
- `"RelatedFindings"`: A list of findings that are related to the updated findings.
- `"Severity"`: Used to update the finding severity.
- `"Types"`: One or more finding types in the format of namespace/category/classifier that
  classify a finding. Valid namespace values are as follows.   Software and Configuration
  Checks   TTPs   Effects   Unusual Behaviors   Sensitive Data Identifications
- `"UserDefinedFields"`: A list of name/value string pairs associated with the finding.
  These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.
- `"VerificationState"`: Indicates the veracity of a finding. The available values for
  VerificationState are as follows.    UNKNOWN – The default disposition of a security
  finding    TRUE_POSITIVE – The security finding is confirmed    FALSE_POSITIVE – The
  security finding was determined to be a false alarm    BENIGN_POSITIVE – A special case
  of TRUE_POSITIVE where the finding doesn't pose any threat, is expected, or both
- `"Workflow"`: Used to update the workflow status of a finding. The workflow status
  indicates the progress of the investigation into the finding.

    create_members(account_details)
    create_members(account_details, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account
used to make the request, which is the master account. If you are integrated with
Organizations, then the master account is the Security Hub administrator account that is
designated by the organization management account.  CreateMembers is always used to add
accounts that are not organization members. For accounts that are part of an organization,
CreateMembers is only used in the following cases:   Security Hub is not configured to
automatically add new accounts in an organization.   The account was disassociated or
deleted in Security Hub.   This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub
enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the  EnableSecurityHub  operation. For
accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then
send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the
InviteMembers  operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes
a member account in Security Hub. Accounts that are part of an organization do not receive
an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub. A permissions
policy is added that permits the master account to view the findings generated in the
member account. When Security Hub is enabled in a member account, findings are sent to both
the member and master accounts.  To remove the association between the master and member
accounts, use the  DisassociateFromMasterAccount  or  DisassociateMembers  operation.
