    batch_import_findings(findings, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Imports security findings generated by a finding provider into Security Hub. This action is
requested by the finding provider to import its findings into Security Hub.
BatchImportFindings must be called by one of the following:   The Amazon Web Services
account that is associated with a finding if you are using the default product ARN or are a
partner sending findings from within a customer's Amazon Web Services account. In these
cases, the identifier of the account that you are calling BatchImportFindings from needs to
be the same as the AwsAccountId attribute for the finding.   An Amazon Web Services account
that Security Hub has allow-listed for an official partner integration. In this case, you
can call BatchImportFindings from the allow-listed account and send findings from different
customer accounts in the same batch.   The maximum allowed size for a finding is 240 Kb. An
error is returned for any finding larger than 240 Kb. After a finding is created,
BatchImportFindings cannot be used to update the following finding fields and objects,
which Security Hub customers use to manage their investigation workflow.    Note

    batch_update_findings(finding_identifiers)
    batch_update_findings(finding_identifiers, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Used by Security Hub customers to update information about their investigation into a
finding. Requested by administrator accounts or member accounts. Administrator accounts can
update findings for their account and their member accounts. Member accounts can update
findings for their account. Updates from BatchUpdateFindings do not affect the value of

Workflow    You can configure IAM policies to restrict access to fields and field values.
For example, you might not want member accounts to be able to suppress findings or change
the finding severity. See Configuring access to BatchUpdateFindings in the Security Hub
User Guide.

# Arguments
- `finding_identifiers`: The list of findings to update. BatchUpdateFindings can be used to
  update up to 100 findings at a time. For each finding, the list provides the finding
  identifier and the ARN of the finding provider.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Confidence"`: The updated value for the finding confidence. Confidence is defined as
  the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue that it was
  intended to identify. Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0
  means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confidence.
- `"Criticality"`: The updated value for the level of importance assigned to the resources
  associated with the findings. A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no
  criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.
- `"Note"`:
- `"RelatedFindings"`: A list of findings that are related to the updated findings.
- `"Severity"`: Used to update the finding severity.
- `"Types"`: One or more finding types in the format of namespace/category/classifier that
  classify a finding. Valid namespace values are as follows.   Software and Configuration
  Checks   TTPs   Effects   Unusual Behaviors   Sensitive Data Identifications
- `"UserDefinedFields"`: A list of name/value string pairs associated with the finding.
  These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.
- `"VerificationState"`: Indicates the veracity of a finding. The available values for
  VerificationState are as follows.    UNKNOWN – The default disposition of a security
  finding    TRUE_POSITIVE – The security finding is confirmed    FALSE_POSITIVE – The
  security finding was determined to be a false alarm    BENIGN_POSITIVE – A special case
  of TRUE_POSITIVE where the finding doesn't pose any threat, is expected, or both
- `"Workflow"`: Used to update the workflow status of a finding. The workflow status
  indicates the progress of the investigation into the finding.

details about cross-Region replication, see Configuring finding aggregation in the Security
Hub User Guide.

# Arguments
- `region_linking_mode`: Indicates whether to aggregate findings from all of the available
  Regions in the current partition. Also determines whether to automatically aggregate

  Security Hub is enabled. When you choose this option, Security Hub also automatically
  aggregates findings from new Regions as Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.
    ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED - Indicates to aggregate findings from all of the Regions

    create_members(account_details)
    create_members(account_details, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account
used to make the request, which is the administrator account. If you are integrated with
Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management
account.  CreateMembers is always used to add accounts that are not organization members.
For accounts that are managed using Organizations, CreateMembers is only used in the
following cases:   Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization
accounts.   The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.   This action can
only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can
use the EnableSecurityHub operation. For accounts that are not organization members, you
create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send
the invitation, you use the InviteMembers operation. If the account owner accepts the
invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub. Accounts that are managed
using Organizations do not receive an invitation. They automatically become a member
account in Security Hub.   If the organization account does not have Security Hub enabled,
then Security Hub and the default standards are automatically enabled. Note that Security
Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management account. The
organization management account must enable Security Hub before the administrator account
enables it as a member account.   For organization accounts that already have Security Hub
enabled, Security Hub does not make any other changes to those accounts. It does not change
their enabled standards or controls.   A permissions policy is added that permits the
administrator account to view the findings generated in the member account. To remove the
association between the administrator and member accounts, use the
DisassociateFromMasterAccount or DisassociateMembers operation.
