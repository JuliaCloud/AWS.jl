    add_tags_to_stream(stream_name, tags)
    add_tags_to_stream(stream_name, tags, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Adds or updates tags for the specified Kinesis data stream. Each time you invoke this
operation, you can specify up to 10 tags. If you want to add more than 10 tags to your
stream, you can invoke this operation multiple times. In total, each stream can have up to
50 tags. If tags have already been assigned to the stream, AddTagsToStream overwrites any
existing tags that correspond to the specified tag keys.  AddTagsToStream has a limit of
five transactions per second per account.

# Arguments
- `stream_name`: The name of the stream.
- `tags`: A set of up to 10 key-value pairs to use to create the tags.

    create_stream(shard_count, stream_name)
    create_stream(shard_count, stream_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that are
continuously emitted from different data sources or producers. Scale-out within a stream is
explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data
records in a stream. You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed
of. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data
read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per
second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input
increases or decreases, you can add or remove shards. The stream name identifies the
stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used by the application. It is also scoped by
AWS Region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two
streams in the same account, but in two different Regions, can have the same name.
CreateStream is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a CreateStream request, Kinesis
Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to CREATING. After the stream
is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to ACTIVE. You should perform read
and write operations only on an ACTIVE stream.  You receive a LimitExceededException when
making a CreateStream request when you try to do one of the following:   Have more than
five streams in the CREATING state at any point in time.   Create more shards than are
authorized for your account.   For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see Amazon
Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. To increase
this limit, contact AWS Support. You can use DescribeStream to check the stream status,
which is returned in StreamStatus.  CreateStream has a limit of five transactions per
second per account.

# Arguments
- `shard_count`: The number of shards that the stream will use. The throughput of the
  stream is a function of the number of shards; more shards are required for greater
  provisioned throughput.
- `stream_name`: A name to identify the stream. The stream name is scoped to the AWS
  account used by the application that creates the stream. It is also scoped by AWS Region.
  That is, two streams in two different AWS accounts can have the same name. Two streams in
  the same AWS account but in two different Regions can also have the same name.

records are accessible after they are added to the stream. The minimum value of a stream's
retention period is 24 hours. This operation may result in lost data. For example, if the

    delete_stream(stream_name)
    delete_stream(stream_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deletes a Kinesis data stream and all its shards and data. You must shut down any
applications that are operating on the stream before you delete the stream. If an
application attempts to operate on a deleted stream, it receives the exception
ResourceNotFoundException. If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can delete it. After a
DeleteStream request, the specified stream is in the DELETING state until Kinesis Data
Streams completes the deletion.  Note: Kinesis Data Streams might continue to accept data
read and write operations, such as PutRecord, PutRecords, and GetRecords, on a stream in
the DELETING state until the stream deletion is complete. When you delete a stream, any
shards in that stream are also deleted, and any tags are dissociated from the stream. You
can use the DescribeStream operation to check the state of the stream, which is returned in
StreamStatus.  DeleteStream has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

    get_records(shard_iterator)
    get_records(shard_iterator, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Gets data records from a Kinesis data stream's shard. Specify a shard iterator using the
ShardIterator parameter. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which
you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in
the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, GetRecords returns an empty list. It
might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records. You can
scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service limits (for more
information, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
Developer Guide). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading
continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call GetRecords in a loop.
Use GetShardIterator to get the shard iterator to specify in the first GetRecords call.
GetRecords returns a new shard iterator in NextShardIterator. Specify the shard iterator
returned in NextShardIterator in subsequent calls to GetRecords. If the shard has been
closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and GetRecords returns null in
NextShardIterator. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard
iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as
the last record to process. Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can
read up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum
supported size or throughput by using the Limit parameter to specify the maximum number of
records that GetRecords can return. Consider your average record size when determining this
limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000. The size of
the data returned by GetRecords varies depending on the utilization of the shard. The
maximum size of data that GetRecords can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of
data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on
the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. GetRecords doesn't return any data when it throws
an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to
GetRecords. However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than
1 second. To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use
the MillisBehindLatest response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch
metrics and other mechanisms (see Monitoring in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer
Guide). Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, ApproximateArrivalTimestamp, that is
set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to
as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer
creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data
records into a stream, for example with PutRecords). The time stamp has millisecond
precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is
always increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time
stamps that are out of order. This operation has a limit of five transactions per second
per shard.

# Arguments
- `shard_iterator`: The position in the shard from which you want to start sequentially
  reading data records. A shard iterator specifies this position using the sequence number of
  a data record in the shard.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Limit"`: The maximum number of records to return. Specify a value of up to 10,000. If
  you specify a value that is greater than 10,000, GetRecords throws
  InvalidArgumentException. The default value is 10,000.

    get_shard_iterator(shard_id, shard_iterator_type, stream_name)
    get_shard_iterator(shard_id, shard_iterator_type, stream_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Gets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is
returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to
start reading data records sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence
number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with
every record ingested in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream.
Each stream has one or more shards. You must specify the shard iterator type. For example,
you can set the ShardIteratorType parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a
specific sequence number by using the AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type.
Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the
AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls
to PutRecord, PutRecords, GetRecords, or DescribeStream. In the request, you can specify
the shard iterator type AT_TIMESTAMP to read records from an arbitrary point in time,
TRIM_HORIZON to cause ShardIterator to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in
the system (the oldest data record in the shard), or LATEST so that you always read the
most recent data in the shard.  When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a
GetShardIterator request to get the first shard iterator for use in your first GetRecords
request and for subsequent reads use the shard iterator returned by the GetRecords request
in NextShardIterator. A new shard iterator is returned by every GetRecords request in
NextShardIterator, which you use in the ShardIterator parameter of the next GetRecords
request.  If a GetShardIterator request is made too often, you receive a
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. For more information about throughput limits, see
GetRecords, and Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. If the
shard is closed, GetShardIterator returns a valid iterator for the last sequence number of
the shard. A shard can be closed as a result of using SplitShard or MergeShards.
GetShardIterator has a limit of five transactions per second per account per open shard.

# Arguments
- `shard_id`: The shard ID of the Kinesis Data Streams shard to get the iterator for.
- `shard_iterator_type`: Determines how the shard iterator is used to start reading data
  records from the shard. The following are the valid Amazon Kinesis shard iterator types:
  AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading from the position denoted by a specific sequence number,
  provided in the value StartingSequenceNumber.   AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading right
  after the position denoted by a specific sequence number, provided in the value
  StartingSequenceNumber.   AT_TIMESTAMP - Start reading from the position denoted by a
  specific time stamp, provided in the value Timestamp.   TRIM_HORIZON - Start reading at the
  last untrimmed record in the shard in the system, which is the oldest data record in the
  shard.   LATEST - Start reading just after the most recent record in the shard, so that you
  always read the most recent data in the shard.
- `stream_name`: The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"StartingSequenceNumber"`: The sequence number of the data record in the shard from
  which to start reading. Used with shard iterator type AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER and
  AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER.
- `"Timestamp"`: The time stamp of the data record from which to start reading. Used with
  shard iterator type AT_TIMESTAMP. A time stamp is the Unix epoch date with precision in
  milliseconds. For example, 2016-04-04T19:58:46.480-00:00 or 1459799926.480. If a record
  with this exact time stamp does not exist, the iterator returned is for the next (later)
  record. If the time stamp is older than the current trim horizon, the iterator returned is
  for the oldest untrimmed data record (TRIM_HORIZON).

    list_shards()
    list_shards(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Lists the shards in a stream and provides information about each shard. This operation has
a limit of 100 transactions per second per data stream.  This API is a new operation that
is used by the Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL). If you have a fine-grained IAM policy
that only allows specific operations, you must update your policy to allow calls to this
API. For more information, see Controlling Access to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Resources
Using IAM.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ExclusiveStartShardId"`: Specify this parameter to indicate that you want to list the
  shards starting with the shard whose ID immediately follows ExclusiveStartShardId. If you
  don't specify this parameter, the default behavior is for ListShards to list the shards
  starting with the first one in the stream. You cannot specify this parameter if you specify
  NextToken.
- `"MaxResults"`: The maximum number of shards to return in a single call to ListShards.
  The minimum value you can specify for this parameter is 1, and the maximum is 10,000, which
  is also the default. When the number of shards to be listed is greater than the value of
  MaxResults, the response contains a NextToken value that you can use in a subsequent call
  to ListShards to list the next set of shards.
- `"NextToken"`: When the number of shards in the data stream is greater than the default
  value for the MaxResults parameter, or if you explicitly specify a value for MaxResults
  that is less than the number of shards in the data stream, the response includes a
  pagination token named NextToken. You can specify this NextToken value in a subsequent call
  to ListShards to list the next set of shards. Don't specify StreamName or
  StreamCreationTimestamp if you specify NextToken because the latter unambiguously
  identifies the stream. You can optionally specify a value for the MaxResults parameter when
  you specify NextToken. If you specify a MaxResults value that is less than the number of
  shards that the operation returns if you don't specify MaxResults, the response will
  contain a new NextToken value. You can use the new NextToken value in a subsequent call to
  the ListShards operation.  Tokens expire after 300 seconds. When you obtain a value for
  NextToken in the response to a call to ListShards, you have 300 seconds to use that value.
  If you specify an expired token in a call to ListShards, you get ExpiredNextTokenException.
- `"ShardFilter"`:
- `"StreamCreationTimestamp"`: Specify this input parameter to distinguish data streams
  that have the same name. For example, if you create a data stream and then delete it, and
  you later create another data stream with the same name, you can use this input parameter
  to specify which of the two streams you want to list the shards for. You cannot specify
  this parameter if you specify the NextToken parameter.
- `"StreamName"`: The name of the data stream whose shards you want to list.  You cannot
  specify this parameter if you specify the NextToken parameter.

Lists the consumers registered to receive data from a stream using enhanced fan-out, and
provides information about each consumer. This operation has a limit of 5 transactions per
second per stream.

# Arguments
- `stream_arn`: The ARN of the Kinesis data stream for which you want to list the
  registered consumers. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS
  Service Namespaces.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"MaxResults"`: The maximum number of consumers that you want a single call of
  ListStreamConsumers to return.
- `"NextToken"`: When the number of consumers that are registered with the data stream is
  greater than the default value for the MaxResults parameter, or if you explicitly specify a
  value for MaxResults that is less than the number of consumers that are registered with the
  data stream, the response includes a pagination token named NextToken. You can specify this
  NextToken value in a subsequent call to ListStreamConsumers to list the next set of
  registered consumers. Don't specify StreamName or StreamCreationTimestamp if you specify
  NextToken because the latter unambiguously identifies the stream. You can optionally
  specify a value for the MaxResults parameter when you specify NextToken. If you specify a
  MaxResults value that is less than the number of consumers that the operation returns if
  you don't specify MaxResults, the response will contain a new NextToken value. You can use
  the new NextToken value in a subsequent call to the ListStreamConsumers operation to list
  the next set of consumers.  Tokens expire after 300 seconds. When you obtain a value for
  NextToken in the response to a call to ListStreamConsumers, you have 300 seconds to use
  that value. If you specify an expired token in a call to ListStreamConsumers, you get
  ExpiredNextTokenException.
- `"StreamCreationTimestamp"`: Specify this input parameter to distinguish data streams
  that have the same name. For example, if you create a data stream and then delete it, and
  you later create another data stream with the same name, you can use this input parameter
  to specify which of the two streams you want to list the consumers for.  You can't specify
  this parameter if you specify the NextToken parameter.

    merge_shards(adjacent_shard_to_merge, shard_to_merge, stream_name)
    merge_shards(adjacent_shard_to_merge, shard_to_merge, stream_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single shard
to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are considered
adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with
no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and
the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could merge these two shards into a
single shard that would have a hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single
child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.
MergeShards is called when there is a need to reduce the overall capacity of a stream
because of excess capacity that is not being used. You must specify the shard to be merged
and the adjacent shard for a stream. For more information about merging shards, see Merge
Two Shards in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. If the stream is in the
ACTIVE state, you can call MergeShards. If a stream is in the CREATING, UPDATING, or
DELETING state, MergeShards returns a ResourceInUseException. If the specified stream does
not exist, MergeShards returns a ResourceNotFoundException.  You can use DescribeStream to
check the state of the stream, which is returned in StreamStatus.  MergeShards is an
asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a MergeShards request, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
immediately returns a response and sets the StreamStatus to UPDATING. After the operation
is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the StreamStatus to ACTIVE. Read and write
operations continue to work while the stream is in the UPDATING state.  You use
DescribeStream to determine the shard IDs that are specified in the MergeShards request.
If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using CreateStream, DeleteStream,
MergeShards, or SplitShard, you receive a LimitExceededException.   MergeShards has a limit
of five transactions per second per account.

# Arguments

    put_record(data, partition_key, stream_name)
    put_record(data, partition_key, stream_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call PutRecord to send data
into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time.
Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write
total of 1 MiB per second. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores,
and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The data blob can be
any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website
clickstream data, and so on. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to
distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong
to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record
to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode
strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function
is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records
to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition
key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the ExplicitHashKey
parameter. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data
Streams Developer Guide.  PutRecord returns the shard ID of where the data record was
placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers
increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards
within a stream. To guarantee strictly increasing ordering, write serially to a shard and
use the SequenceNumberForOrdering parameter. For more information, see Adding Data to a
Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.  After you write a record to a
stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream.  If a PutRecord
request cannot be processed because of insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard
involved in the request, PutRecord throws ProvisionedThroughputExceededException.  By
default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a
stream. You can use IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod or DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod to
modify this retention period.

# Arguments
- `data`: The data blob to put into the record, which is base64-encoded when the blob is
  serialized. When the data blob (the payload before base64-encoding) is added to the
  partition key size, the total size must not exceed the maximum record size (1 MiB).
- `partition_key`: Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to.
  Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each
  key. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams uses the partition key as input to a hash function that
  maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash
  function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data
  records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same
  partition key map to the same shard within the stream.
- `stream_name`: The name of the stream to put the data record into.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ExplicitHashKey"`: The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data
  record is assigned to by overriding the partition key hash.
- `"SequenceNumberForOrdering"`: Guarantees strictly increasing sequence numbers, for puts
  from the same client and to the same partition key. Usage: set the
  SequenceNumberForOrdering of record n to the sequence number of record n-1 (as returned in
  the result when putting record n-1). If this parameter is not set, records are coarsely
  ordered based on arrival time.

    put_records(records, stream_name)
    put_records(records, stream_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Writes multiple data records into a Kinesis data stream in a single call (also referred to
as a PutRecords request). Use this operation to send data into the stream for data
ingestion and processing.  Each PutRecords request can support up to 500 records. Each
record in the request can be as large as 1 MiB, up to a limit of 5 MiB for the entire
request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per
second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. You must specify the name of
the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; and an array of request Records,
with each record in the array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size
limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob. The data blob can be
any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website
clickstream data, and so on. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to
a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5
hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated
data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the
same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see
Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. Each record in
the Records array may include an optional parameter, ExplicitHashKey, which overrides the
partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to determine
explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information, see Adding Multiple
Records with PutRecords in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. The PutRecords
response includes an array of response Records. Each record in the response array directly
correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the
bottom of the request and response. The response Records array always includes the same
number of records as the request array. The response Records array includes both
successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process
all records in each PutRecords request. A single record failure does not stop the
processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn't guarantee the ordering of
records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the stream, use
PutRecord instead of PutRecords, and write to the same shard. A successfully processed
record includes ShardId and SequenceNumber values. The ShardId parameter identifies the
shard in the stream where the record is stored. The SequenceNumber parameter is an
identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream. An
unsuccessfully processed record includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage values. ErrorCode
reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values:
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException or InternalFailure. ErrorMessage provides more
detailed information about the ProvisionedThroughputExceededException exception including
the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For more
information about partially successful responses, see Adding Multiple Records with
PutRecords in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.  After you write a record to
a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream.  By default, data
records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can
use IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod or DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod to modify this retention
period.

Registers a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this operation, the consumer
you register can then call SubscribeToShard to receive data from the stream using enhanced
fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is

Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to increase the stream's
capacity to ingest and transport data. SplitShard is called when there is a need to
increase the overall capacity of a stream because of an expected increase in the volume of
data records being ingested.  You can also use SplitShard when a shard appears to be
approaching its maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data into the
specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call
SplitShard to increase stream capacity, so that more Kinesis Data Streams applications can
simultaneously read data from the stream for real-time processing.  You must specify the
shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position in the shard where the shard
gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash key might be the average of the beginning
and ending hash key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the
shard. For more information, see Split a Shard in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer
Guide. You can use DescribeStream to determine the shard ID and hash key values for the
ShardToSplit and NewStartingHashKey parameters that are specified in the SplitShard
request.  SplitShard is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a SplitShard request,
Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets the stream status to UPDATING.
After the operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to ACTIVE.
Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the UPDATING state.  You
can use DescribeStream to check the status of the stream, which is returned in
StreamStatus. If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call SplitShard. If a stream is
in CREATING or UPDATING or DELETING states, DescribeStream returns a
ResourceInUseException. If the specified stream does not exist, DescribeStream returns a
ResourceNotFoundException. If you try to create more shards than are authorized for your
account, you receive a LimitExceededException.  For the default shard limit for an AWS
account, see Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer
Guide. To increase this limit, contact AWS Support. If you try to operate on too many
streams simultaneously using CreateStream, DeleteStream, MergeShards, and/or SplitShard,

# Arguments
- `new_starting_hash_key`: A hash key value for the starting hash key of one of the child
  shards created by the split. The hash key range for a given shard constitutes a set of
  ordered contiguous positive integers. The value for NewStartingHashKey must be in the range
  of hash keys being mapped into the shard. The NewStartingHashKey hash key value and all
  higher hash key values in hash key range are distributed to one of the child shards. All
  the lower hash key values in the range are distributed to the other child shard.

operation, we recommend that you specify a target shard count that is a multiple of 25%

if you specify a target that isn't a multiple of 25%, the scaling action might take longer
to complete.  This operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot do
the following:   Scale more than ten times per rolling 24-hour period per stream   Scale up
to more than double your current shard count for a stream   Scale down below half your
current shard count for a stream   Scale up to more than 500 shards in a stream   Scale a
stream with more than 500 shards down unless the result is less than 500 shards   Scale up
to more than the shard limit for your account   For the default limits for an AWS account,
see Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. To request an
increase in the call rate limit, the shard limit for this API, or your overall shard limit,
use the limits form.

# Arguments
- `scaling_type`: The scaling type. Uniform scaling creates shards of equal size.
- `stream_name`: The name of the stream.
- `target_shard_count`: The new number of shards. This value has the following default
  limits. By default, you cannot do the following:    Set this value to more than double your
  current shard count for a stream.   Set this value below half your current shard count for
  a stream.   Set this value to more than 500 shards in a stream (the default limit for shard
  count per stream is 500 per account per region), unless you request a limit increase.
  Scale a stream with more than 500 shards down unless you set this value to less than 500
  shards.
