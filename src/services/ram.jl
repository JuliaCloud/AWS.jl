    accept_resource_share_invitation(resource_share_invitation_arn)
    accept_resource_share_invitation(resource_share_invitation_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Accepts an invitation to a resource share from another Amazon Web Services account. After
you accept the invitation, the resources included in the resource share are available to
interact with in the relevant Amazon Web Services Management Consoles and tools.

# Arguments
- `resource_share_invitation_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the invitation that
  you want to accept.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientToken"`: Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
  the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally
  performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an
  operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend
  that you use a UUID type of value.. If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web
  Services generates a random one for you. If you retry the operation with the same
  ClientToken, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an
  IdempotentParameterMismatch error.

Adds the specified list of principals and list of resources to a resource share. Principals
that already have access to this resource share immediately receive access to the added
resources. Newly added principals immediately receive access to the resources shared in
this resource share.

# Arguments
- `resource_share_arn`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share that
  you want to add principals or resources to.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientToken"`: Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
  the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally
  performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an
  operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend
  that you use a UUID type of value.. If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web
  Services generates a random one for you. If you retry the operation with the same
  ClientToken, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an
  IdempotentParameterMismatch error.
- `"principals"`: Specifies a list of principals to whom you want to the resource share.
  This can be null if you want to add only resources. What the principals can do with the
  resources in the share is determined by the RAM permissions that you associate with the
  resource share. See AssociateResourceSharePermission. You can include the following values:
    An Amazon Web Services account ID, for example: 123456789012    An Amazon Resource Name
  (ARN) of an organization in Organizations, for example:
  organizations::123456789012:organization/o-exampleorgid    An ARN of an organizational unit
  (OU) in Organizations, for example:
  organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid-exampleouid123    An ARN of
  an IAM role, for example: iam::123456789012:role/rolename    An ARN of an IAM user, for
  example: iam::123456789012user/username     Not all resource types can be shared with IAM
  roles and users. For more information, see Sharing with IAM roles and users in the Resource
  Access Manager User Guide.
- `"resourceArns"`: Specifies a list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources that
  you want to share. This can be null if you want to add only principals.
- `"sources"`: Specifies from which source accounts the service principal has access to the
  resources in this resource share.

    associate_resource_share_permission(permission_arn, resource_share_arn)
    associate_resource_share_permission(permission_arn, resource_share_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Adds or replaces the RAM permission for a resource type included in a resource share. You
can have exactly one permission associated with each resource type in the resource share.
You can add a new RAM permission only if there are currently no resources of that resource
type currently in the resource share.

# Arguments
- `permission_arn`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the RAM permission to
  associate with the resource share. To find the ARN for a permission, use either the
  ListPermissions operation or go to the Permissions library page in the RAM console and then
  choose the name of the permission. The ARN is displayed on the detail page.
- `resource_share_arn`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share to
  which you want to add or replace permissions.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientToken"`: Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
  the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally
  performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an
  operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend
  that you use a UUID type of value.. If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web
  Services generates a random one for you. If you retry the operation with the same
  ClientToken, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an
  IdempotentParameterMismatch error.
- `"permissionVersion"`: Specifies the version of the RAM permission to associate with the
  resource share. You can specify only the version that is currently set as the default
  version for the permission. If you also set the replace pararameter to true, then this
  operation updates an outdated version of the permission to the current default version.
  You don't need to specify this parameter because the default behavior is to use the version
  that is currently set as the default version for the permission. This parameter is
  supported for backwards compatibility.
- `"replace"`: Specifies whether the specified permission should replace the existing
  permission associated with the resource share. Use true to replace the current permissions.
  Use false to add the permission to a resource share that currently doesn't have a
  permission. The default value is false.  A resource share can have only one permission per
  resource type. If a resource share already has a permission for the specified resource type
  and you don't set replace to true then the operation returns an error. This helps prevent
  accidental overwriting of a permission.

    create_permission(name, policy_template, resource_type, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a customer managed permission for a specified resource type that you can attach to
resource shares. It is created in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you call the
operation.

# Arguments
- `name`: Specifies the name of the customer managed permission. The name must be unique
  within the Amazon Web Services Region.
- `policy_template`: A string in JSON format string that contains the following elements of
  a resource-based policy:    Effect: must be set to ALLOW.    Action: specifies the actions
  that are allowed by this customer managed permission. The list must contain only actions
  that are supported by the specified resource type. For a list of all actions supported by
  each resource type, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services
  services in the Identity and Access Management User Guide.    Condition: (optional)
  specifies conditional parameters that must evaluate to true when a user attempts an action
  for that action to be allowed. For more information about the Condition element, see IAM
  policies: Condition element in the Identity and Access Management User Guide.   This
  template can't include either the Resource or Principal elements. Those are both filled in
  by RAM when it instantiates the resource-based policy on each resource shared using this
  managed permission. The Resource comes from the ARN of the specific resource that you are
  sharing. The Principal comes from the list of identities added to the resource share.
- `resource_type`: Specifies the name of the resource type that this customer managed
  permission applies to. The format is  &lt;service-code&gt;:&lt;resource-type&gt;  and is
  not case sensitive. For example, to specify an Amazon EC2 Subnet, you can use the string
  ec2:subnet. To see the list of valid values for this parameter, query the ListResourceTypes
  operation.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientToken"`: Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
  the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally

- `"tags"`: Specifies a list of one or more tag key and value pairs to attach to the
  permission.

Creates a resource share. You can provide a list of the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for
the resources that you want to share, a list of principals you want to share the resources
with, and the permissions to grant those principals.  Sharing a resource makes it available
for use by principals outside of the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource.
Sharing doesn't change any permissions or quotas that apply to the resource in the account
that created it.

# Arguments
- `name`: Specifies the name of the resource share.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"allowExternalPrincipals"`: Specifies whether principals outside your organization in
  Organizations can be associated with a resource share. A value of true lets you share with
  individual Amazon Web Services accounts that are not in your organization. A value of false
  only has meaning if your account is a member of an Amazon Web Services Organization. The
  default value is true.
- `"clientToken"`: Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
  the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally
  performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an
  operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend
  that you use a UUID type of value.. If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web
  Services generates a random one for you. If you retry the operation with the same
  ClientToken, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an
  IdempotentParameterMismatch error.
- `"permissionArns"`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the RAM permission to
  associate with the resource share. If you do not specify an ARN for the permission, RAM
  automatically attaches the default version of the permission for each resource type. You
  can associate only one permission with each resource type included in the resource share.
- `"principals"`: Specifies a list of one or more principals to associate with the resource
  share. You can include the following values:   An Amazon Web Services account ID, for
  example: 123456789012    An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization in Organizations,
  for example: organizations::123456789012:organization/o-exampleorgid    An ARN of an
  organizational unit (OU) in Organizations, for example:
  organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid-exampleouid123    An ARN of
  an IAM role, for example: iam::123456789012:role/rolename    An ARN of an IAM user, for
  example: iam::123456789012user/username     Not all resource types can be shared with IAM
  roles and users. For more information, see Sharing with IAM roles and users in the Resource
  Access Manager User Guide.
- `"resourceArns"`: Specifies a list of one or more ARNs of the resources to associate with
  the resource share.
- `"sources"`: Specifies from which source accounts the service principal has access to the
  resources in this resource share.
- `"tags"`: Specifies one or more tags to attach to the resource share itself. It doesn't
  attach the tags to the resources associated with the resource share.

    promote_permission_created_from_policy(name, permission_arn)
    promote_permission_created_from_policy(name, permission_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

When you attach a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automatically creates a resource
share of featureSet=CREATED_FROM_POLICY with a managed permission that has the same IAM
permissions as the original resource-based policy. However, this type of managed permission
is visible to only the resource share owner, and the associated resource share can't be
modified by using RAM. This operation creates a separate, fully manageable customer managed
permission that has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based policy. You can
associate this customer managed permission to any resource shares. Before you use
PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy, you should first run this operation to ensure that
you have an appropriate customer managed permission that can be associated with the
promoted resource share.    The original CREATED_FROM_POLICY policy isn't deleted, and
resource shares using that original policy aren't automatically updated.   You can't modify
a CREATED_FROM_POLICY resource share so you can't associate the new customer managed
permission by using ReplacePermsissionAssociations. However, if you use
PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy, that operation automatically associates the fully
manageable customer managed permission to the newly promoted STANDARD resource share.
After you promote a resource share, if the original CREATED_FROM_POLICY managed permission
has no other associations to A resource share, then RAM automatically deletes it.

# Arguments
- `name`: Specifies a name for the promoted customer managed permission.
- `permission_arn`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CREATED_FROM_POLICY
  permission that you want to promote. You can get this Amazon Resource Name (ARN) by calling
  the ListResourceSharePermissions operation.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientToken"`: Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
  the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally
  performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an
  operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend
  that you use a UUID type of value.. If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web
  Services generates a random one for you. If you retry the operation with the same
  ClientToken, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an

    replace_permission_associations(from_permission_arn, to_permission_arn)
    replace_permission_associations(from_permission_arn, to_permission_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates all resource shares that use a managed permission to a different managed
permission. This operation always applies the default version of the target managed
permission. You can optionally specify that the update applies to only resource shares that
currently use a specified version. This enables you to update to the latest version,
without changing the which managed permission is used. You can use this operation to update
all of your resource shares to use the current default version of the permission by
specifying the same value for the fromPermissionArn and toPermissionArn parameters. You can
use the optional fromPermissionVersion parameter to update only those resources that use a
specified version of the managed permission to the new managed permission.  To successfully
perform this operation, you must have permission to update the resource-based policy on all
affected resource types.

# Arguments
- `from_permission_arn`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the managed permission
  that you want to replace.
- `to_permission_arn`: Specifies the ARN of the managed permission that you want to
  associate with resource shares in place of the one specified by fromPerssionArn and
  fromPermissionVersion. The operation always associates the version that is currently the
  default for the specified managed permission.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"clientToken"`: Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
  the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally
  performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an
  operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend
  that you use a UUID type of value.. If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web
  Services generates a random one for you. If you retry the operation with the same
  ClientToken, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an
  IdempotentParameterMismatch error.
- `"fromPermissionVersion"`: Specifies that you want to updated the permissions for only
  those resource shares that use the specified version of the managed permission.

Designates the specified version number as the default version for the specified customer
managed permission. New resource shares automatically use this new default permission.
Existing resource shares continue to use their original permission version, but you can use
ReplacePermissionAssociations to update them.

# Arguments
- `permission_arn`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer managed
