    BulkPublish()

Initiates a bulk publish of all existing datasets for an Identity Pool to the configured stream. Customers are limited to one successful bulk publish per 24 hours. Bulk publish is an asynchronous request, customers can see the status of the request via the GetBulkPublishDetails operation. This API can only be called with developer credentials. You cannot call this API with the temporary user credentials provided by Cognito Identity.

Required Parameters
{
  "IdentityPoolId": "A name-spaced GUID (for example, us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon Cognito. GUID generation is unique within a region."

"""
    DeleteDataset()

Deletes the specific dataset. The dataset will be deleted permanently, and the action can't be undone. Datasets that this dataset was merged with will no longer report the merge.

    UpdateRecords()

Posts updates to records and adds and deletes records for a dataset and user. The sync count in the record patch is your last known sync count for that record. The server will reject an UpdateRecords request with a ResourceConflictException if you try to patch a record with a new value but a stale sync count. For example, if the sync count on the server is 5 for a key called highScore and you try and submit a new highScore with sync count of 4, the request will be rejected. To obtain the current sync count for a record, call ListRecords. On a successful update of the record, the response returns the new sync count for that record. You should present that sync count the next time you try to update that same record. When the record does not exist, specify the sync count as 0. This API can be called with temporary user credentials provided by Cognito Identity or with developer credentials.

Required Parameters
{
  "DatasetName": "A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (dash), and '.' (dot).",
