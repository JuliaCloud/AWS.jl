    UpdateRecords()

Posts updates to records and adds and deletes records for a dataset and user. The sync count in the record patch is your last known sync count for that record. The server will reject an UpdateRecords request with a ResourceConflictException if you try to patch a record with a new value but a stale sync count. For example, if the sync count on the server is 5 for a key called highScore and you try and submit a new highScore with sync count of 4, the request will be rejected. To obtain the current sync count for a record, call ListRecords. On a successful update of the record, the response returns the new sync count for that record. You should present that sync count the next time you try to update that same record. When the record does not exist, specify the sync count as 0.
