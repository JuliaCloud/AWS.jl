    CreateCampaign()

Creates a campaign by deploying a solution version. When a client calls the GetRecommendations and GetPersonalizedRanking APIs, a campaign is specified in the request.  Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling  A transaction is a single GetRecommendations or GetPersonalizedRanking call. Transactions per second (TPS) is the throughput and unit of billing for Amazon Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (minProvisionedTPS) specifies the baseline throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum billing charge. If your TPS increases beyond minProvisionedTPS, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minProvisionedTPS, to maintain a 70% utilization. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. It's recommended to start with a low minProvisionedTPS, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary.  Status  A campaign can be in one of the following states:   CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED   DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS   To get the campaign status, call DescribeCampaign.  Wait until the status of the campaign is ACTIVE before asking the campaign for recommendations.   Related APIs     ListCampaigns     DescribeCampaign     UpdateCampaign     DeleteCampaign   

# Required Parameters
- `minProvisionedTPS`: Specifies the requested minimum provisioned transactions (recommendations) per second that Amazon Personalize will support.
- `name`: A name for the new campaign. The campaign name must be unique within your account.
- `solutionVersionArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version to deploy.

    CreateEventTracker()

Creates an event tracker that you use when sending event data to the specified dataset group using the PutEvents API.

Only one event tracker can be associated with a dataset group. You will get an error if you call CreateEventTracker using the same dataset group as an existing event tracker.

"""
    CreateSolution()

Creates the configuration for training a model. A trained model is known as a solution. After the configuration is created, you train the model (create a solution) by calling the CreateSolutionVersion operation. Every time you call CreateSolutionVersion, a new version of the solution is created. After creating a solution version, you check its accuracy by calling GetSolutionMetrics. When you are satisfied with the version, you deploy it using CreateCampaign. The campaign provides recommendations to a client through the GetRecommendations API. To train a model, Amazon Personalize requires training data and a recipe. The training data comes from the dataset group that you provide in the request. A recipe specifies the training algorithm and a feature transformation. You can specify one of the predefined recipes provided by Amazon Personalize. Alternatively, you can specify performAutoML and Amazon Personalize will analyze your data and select the optimum USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe for you.  Status  A solution can be in one of the following states:   CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED   DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS   To get the status of the solution, call DescribeSolution.

# Required Parameters
- `datasetGroupArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group that provides the training data.
- `name`: The name for the solution.

# Optional Parameters
- `eventType`: When your have multiple event types (using an EVENT_TYPE schema field), this parameter specifies which event type (for example, 'click' or 'like') is used for training the model.
- `performAutoML`: Whether to perform automated machine learning (AutoML). The default is false. For this case, you must specify recipeArn. When set to true, Amazon Personalize analyzes your training data and selects the optimal USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe and hyperparameters. In this case, you must omit recipeArn. Amazon Personalize determines the optimal recipe by running tests with different values for the hyperparameters. AutoML lengthens the training process as compared to selecting a specific recipe.
- `performHPO`: Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on the specified or selected recipe. The default is false. When performing AutoML, this parameter is always true and you should not set it to false.
- `recipeArn`: The ARN of the recipe to use for model training. Only specified when performAutoML is false.
- `solutionConfig`: The configuration to use with the solution. When performAutoML is set to true, Amazon Personalize only evaluates the autoMLConfig section of the solution configuration.

Choose UPDATE when you want to incrementally update your solution version instead of creating an entirely new one.

Describes a recipe. A recipe contains three items:   An algorithm that trains a model.   Hyperparameters that govern the training.
