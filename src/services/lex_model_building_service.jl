    CreateBotVersion()

Creates a new version of the bot based on the  LATEST version. If the  LATEST version of this resource hasn't changed since you created the last version, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last created version.  You can update only the  LATEST version of the bot. You can't update the numbered versions that you create with the CreateBotVersion operation.   When you create the first version of a bot, Amazon Lex sets the version to 1. Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see versioning-intro.   This operation requires permission for the lex:CreateBotVersion action. 

Required Parameters
name => The name of the bot that you want to create a new version of. The name is case sensitive. 

Optional Parameters
checksum => Identifies a specific revision of the  LATEST version of the bot. If you specify a checksum and the  LATEST version of the bot has a different checksum, a PreconditionFailedException exception is returned and Amazon Lex doesn't publish a new version. If you don't specify a checksum, Amazon Lex publishes the  LATEST version.

    DeleteBot()

Deletes all versions of the bot, including the  LATEST version. To delete a specific version of the bot, use the DeleteBotVersion operation. The DeleteBot operation doesn't immediately remove the bot schema. Instead, it is marked for deletion and removed later. Amazon Lex stores utterances indefinitely for improving the ability of your bot to respond to user inputs. These utterances are not removed when the bot is deleted. To remove the utterances, use the DeleteUtterances operation. If a bot has an alias, you can't delete it. Instead, the DeleteBot operation returns a ResourceInUseException exception that includes a reference to the alias that refers to the bot. To remove the reference to the bot, delete the alias. If you get the same exception again, delete the referring alias until the DeleteBot operation is successful. This operation requires permissions for the lex:DeleteBot action.

Utterance statistics are generated once a day. Data is available for the last 15 days. You can request information for up to 5 versions of your bot in each request. Amazon Lex returns the most frequent utterances received by the bot in the last 15 days. The response contains information about a maximum of 100 utterances for each version. If you set childDirected field to true when you created your bot, or if you opted out of participating in improving Amazon Lex, utterances are not available. This operation requires permissions for the lex:GetUtterancesView action.

Required Parameters
bot_versions => An array of bot versions for which utterance information should be returned. The limit is 5 versions per request.
botname => The name of the bot for which utterance information should be returned.
status_type => To return utterances that were recognized and handled, use Detected. To return utterances that were not recognized, use Missed.

    PutBot()

Creates an Amazon Lex conversational bot or replaces an existing bot. When you create or update a bot you are only required to specify a name, a locale, and whether the bot is directed toward children under age 13. You can use this to add intents later, or to remove intents from an existing bot. When you create a bot with the minimum information, the bot is created or updated but Amazon Lex returns the  response FAILED. You can build the bot after you add one or more intents. For more information about Amazon Lex bots, see how-it-works.  If you specify the name of an existing bot, the fields in the request replace the existing values in the  LATEST version of the bot. Amazon Lex removes any fields that you don't provide values for in the request, except for the idleTTLInSeconds and privacySettings fields, which are set to their default values. If you don't specify values for required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception. This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutBot action. For more information, see security-iam.

Required Parameters
childDirected => For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model Building Service, you must specify whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by specifying true or false in the childDirected field. By specifying true in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. By specifying false in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not specify a default value for the childDirected field that does not accurately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. If your use of Amazon Lex relates to a website, program, or other application that is directed in whole or in part, to children under age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental consent under COPPA. For information regarding the use of Amazon Lex in connection with websites, programs, or other applications that are directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13, see the Amazon Lex FAQ. 
locale =>  Specifies the target locale for the bot. Any intent used in the bot must be compatible with the locale of the bot.  The default is en-US.
name => The name of the bot. The name is not case sensitive. 

Optional Parameters
abortStatement => When Amazon Lex can't understand the user's input in context, it tries to elicit the information a few times. After that, Amazon Lex sends the message defined in abortStatement to the user, and then aborts the conversation. To set the number of retries, use the valueElicitationPrompt field for the slot type.  For example, in a pizza ordering bot, Amazon Lex might ask a user "What type of crust would you like?" If the user's response is not one of the expected responses (for example, "thin crust, "deep dish," etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few more times.  For example, in a pizza ordering application, OrderPizza might be one of the intents. This intent might require the CrustType slot. You specify the valueElicitationPrompt field when you create the CrustType slot. If you have defined a fallback intent the abort statement will not be sent to the user, the fallback intent is used instead. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent.
checksum => Identifies a specific revision of the  LATEST version. When you create a new bot, leave the checksum field blank. If you specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception. When you want to update a bot, set the checksum field to the checksum of the most recent revision of the  LATEST version. If you don't specify the  checksum field, or if the checksum does not match the  LATEST version, you get a PreconditionFailedException exception.
clarificationPrompt => When Amazon Lex doesn't understand the user's intent, it uses this message to get clarification. To specify how many times Amazon Lex should repeat the clarification prompt, use the maxAttempts field. If Amazon Lex still doesn't understand, it sends the message in the abortStatement field.  When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests the correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that orders pizza and drinks, you might create this clarification prompt: "What would you like to do? You can say 'Order a pizza' or 'Order a drink.'" If you have defined a fallback intent, it will be invoked if the clarification prompt is repeated the number of times defined in the maxAttempts field. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent. If you don't define a clarification prompt, at runtime Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception in three cases:    Follow-up prompt - When the user responds to a follow-up prompt but does not provide an intent. For example, in response to a follow-up prompt that says "Would you like anything else today?" the user says "Yes." Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception because it does not have a clarification prompt to send to the user to get an intent.   Lambda function - When using a Lambda function, you return an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.   PutSession operation - When using the PutSession operation, you send an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.  
createVersion => When set to true a new numbered version of the bot is created. This is the same as calling the CreateBotVersion operation. If you don't specify createVersion, the default is false.
description => A description of the bot.
detectSentiment => When set to true user utterances are sent to Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis. If you don't specify detectSentiment, the default is false.
idleSessionTTLInSeconds => The maximum time in seconds that Amazon Lex retains the data gathered in a conversation. A user interaction session remains active for the amount of time specified. If no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout. For example, suppose that a user chooses the OrderPizza intent, but gets sidetracked halfway through placing an order. If the user doesn't complete the order within the specified time, Amazon Lex discards the slot information that it gathered, and the user must start over. If you don't include the idleSessionTTLInSeconds element in a PutBot operation request, Amazon Lex uses the default value. This is also true if the request replaces an existing bot. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
intents => An array of Intent objects. Each intent represents a command that a user can express. For example, a pizza ordering bot might support an OrderPizza intent. For more information, see how-it-works.
processBehavior => If you set the processBehavior element to BUILD, Amazon Lex builds the bot so that it can be run. If you set the element to SAVE Amazon Lex saves the bot, but doesn't build it.  If you don't specify this value, the default value is BUILD.
tags => A list of tags to add to the bot. You can only add tags when you create a bot, you can't use the PutBot operation to update the tags on a bot. To update tags, use the TagResource operation.
voiceId => The Amazon Polly voice ID that you want Amazon Lex to use for voice interactions with the user. The locale configured for the voice must match the locale of the bot. For more information, see Voices in Amazon Polly in the Amazon Polly Developer Guide.

    PutBotAlias()

Creates an alias for the specified version of the bot or replaces an alias for the specified bot. To change the version of the bot that the alias points to, replace the alias. For more information about aliases, see versioning-aliases. This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutBotAlias action. 

Required Parameters
botName => The name of the bot.
botVersion => The version of the bot.
name => The name of the alias. The name is not case sensitive.

Optional Parameters
checksum => Identifies a specific revision of the  LATEST version. When you create a new bot alias, leave the checksum field blank. If you specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception. When you want to update a bot alias, set the checksum field to the checksum of the most recent revision of the  LATEST version. If you don't specify the  checksum field, or if the checksum does not match the  LATEST version, you get a PreconditionFailedException exception.
conversationLogs => Settings for conversation logs for the alias.
description => A description of the alias.
tags => A list of tags to add to the bot alias. You can only add tags when you create an alias, you can't use the PutBotAlias operation to update the tags on a bot alias. To update tags, use the TagResource operation.

"""
    PutIntent()

Creates an intent or replaces an existing intent. To define the interaction between the user and your bot, you use one or more intents. For a pizza ordering bot, for example, you would create an OrderPizza intent.  To create an intent or replace an existing intent, you must provide the following:   Intent name. For example, OrderPizza.   Sample utterances. For example, "Can I order a pizza, please." and "I want to order a pizza."   Information to be gathered. You specify slot types for the information that your bot will request from the user. You can specify standard slot types, such as a date or a time, or custom slot types such as the size and crust of a pizza.   How the intent will be fulfilled. You can provide a Lambda function or configure the intent to return the intent information to the client application. If you use a Lambda function, when all of the intent information is available, Amazon Lex invokes your Lambda function. If you configure your intent to return the intent information to the client application.    You can specify other optional information in the request, such as:   A confirmation prompt to ask the user to confirm an intent. For example, "Shall I order your pizza?"   A conclusion statement to send to the user after the intent has been fulfilled. For example, "I placed your pizza order."   A follow-up prompt that asks the user for additional activity. For example, asking "Do you want to order a drink with your pizza?"   If you specify an existing intent name to update the intent, Amazon Lex replaces the values in the  LATEST version of the intent with the values in the request. Amazon Lex removes fields that you don't provide in the request. If you don't specify the required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception. When you update the  LATEST version of an intent, the status field of any bot that uses the  LATEST version of the intent is set to NOT_BUILT. For more information, see how-it-works. This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutIntent action.

Required Parameters
name => The name of the intent. The name is not case sensitive.  The name can't match a built-in intent name, or a built-in intent name with "AMAZON." removed. For example, because there is a built-in intent called AMAZON.HelpIntent, you can't create a custom intent called HelpIntent. For a list of built-in intents, see Standard Built-in Intents in the Alexa Skills Kit.

Optional Parameters
checksum => Identifies a specific revision of the  LATEST version. When you create a new intent, leave the checksum field blank. If you specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception. When you want to update a intent, set the checksum field to the checksum of the most recent revision of the  LATEST version. If you don't specify the  checksum field, or if the checksum does not match the  LATEST version, you get a PreconditionFailedException exception.
conclusionStatement =>  The statement that you want Amazon Lex to convey to the user after the intent is successfully fulfilled by the Lambda function.  This element is relevant only if you provide a Lambda function in the fulfillmentActivity. If you return the intent to the client application, you can't specify this element.  The followUpPrompt and conclusionStatement are mutually exclusive. You can specify only one. 
confirmationPrompt => Prompts the user to confirm the intent. This question should have a yes or no answer. Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges that the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with the OrderPizza intent, you might want to confirm that the order is correct before placing it. For other intents, such as intents that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask the user for confirmation before providing the information.   You you must provide both the rejectionStatement and the confirmationPrompt, or neither. 
createVersion => When set to true a new numbered version of the intent is created. This is the same as calling the CreateIntentVersion operation. If you do not specify createVersion, the default is false.
description => A description of the intent.
dialogCodeHook =>  Specifies a Lambda function to invoke for each user input. You can invoke this Lambda function to personalize user interaction.  For example, suppose your bot determines that the user is John. Your Lambda function might retrieve John's information from a backend database and prepopulate some of the values. For example, if you find that John is gluten intolerant, you might set the corresponding intent slot, GlutenIntolerant, to true. You might find John's phone number and set the corresponding session attribute. 
followUpPrompt => Amazon Lex uses this prompt to solicit additional activity after fulfilling an intent. For example, after the OrderPizza intent is fulfilled, you might prompt the user to order a drink. The action that Amazon Lex takes depends on the user's response, as follows:   If the user says "Yes" it responds with the clarification prompt that is configured for the bot.   if the user says "Yes" and continues with an utterance that triggers an intent it starts a conversation for the intent.   If the user says "No" it responds with the rejection statement configured for the the follow-up prompt.   If it doesn't recognize the utterance it repeats the follow-up prompt again.   The followUpPrompt field and the conclusionStatement field are mutually exclusive. You can specify only one. 
fulfillmentActivity => Required. Describes how the intent is fulfilled. For example, after a user provides all of the information for a pizza order, fulfillmentActivity defines how the bot places an order with a local pizza store.   You might configure Amazon Lex to return all of the intent information to the client application, or direct it to invoke a Lambda function that can process the intent (for example, place an order with a pizzeria). 
kendraConfiguration => Configuration information required to use the AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent intent to connect to an Amazon Kendra index. For more information, see  AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent.
parentIntentSignature => A unique identifier for the built-in intent to base this intent on. To find the signature for an intent, see Standard Built-in Intents in the Alexa Skills Kit.
rejectionStatement => When the user answers "no" to the question defined in confirmationPrompt, Amazon Lex responds with this statement to acknowledge that the intent was canceled.   You must provide both the rejectionStatement and the confirmationPrompt, or neither. 
sampleUtterances => An array of utterances (strings) that a user might say to signal the intent. For example, "I want {PizzaSize} pizza", "Order {Quantity} {PizzaSize} pizzas".  In each utterance, a slot name is enclosed in curly braces. 
slots => An array of intent slots. At runtime, Amazon Lex elicits required slot values from the user using prompts defined in the slots. For more information, see how-it-works.

"""
    PutSlotType()

Creates a custom slot type or replaces an existing custom slot type. To create a custom slot type, specify a name for the slot type and a set of enumeration values, which are the values that a slot of this type can assume. For more information, see how-it-works. If you specify the name of an existing slot type, the fields in the request replace the existing values in the  LATEST version of the slot type. Amazon Lex removes the fields that you don't provide in the request. If you don't specify required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception. When you update the  LATEST version of a slot type, if a bot uses the  LATEST version of an intent that contains the slot type, the bot's status field is set to NOT_BUILT. This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutSlotType action.

Required Parameters
name => The name of the slot type. The name is not case sensitive.  The name can't match a built-in slot type name, or a built-in slot type name with "AMAZON." removed. For example, because there is a built-in slot type called AMAZON.DATE, you can't create a custom slot type called DATE. For a list of built-in slot types, see Slot Type Reference in the Alexa Skills Kit.

Optional Parameters
checksum => Identifies a specific revision of the  LATEST version. When you create a new slot type, leave the checksum field blank. If you specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception. When you want to update a slot type, set the checksum field to the checksum of the most recent revision of the  LATEST version. If you don't specify the  checksum field, or if the checksum does not match the  LATEST version, you get a PreconditionFailedException exception.
createVersion => When set to true a new numbered version of the slot type is created. This is the same as calling the CreateSlotTypeVersion operation. If you do not specify createVersion, the default is false.
description => A description of the slot type.
enumerationValues => A list of EnumerationValue objects that defines the values that the slot type can take. Each value can have a list of synonyms, which are additional values that help train the machine learning model about the values that it resolves for a slot.  When Amazon Lex resolves a slot value, it generates a resolution list that contains up to five possible values for the slot. If you are using a Lambda function, this resolution list is passed to the function. If you are not using a Lambda function you can choose to return the value that the user entered or the first value in the resolution list as the slot value. The valueSelectionStrategy field indicates the option to use. 
parentSlotTypeSignature => The built-in slot type used as the parent of the slot type. When you define a parent slot type, the new slot type has all of the same configuration as the parent. Only AMAZON.AlphaNumeric is supported.
slotTypeConfigurations => Configuration information that extends the parent built-in slot type. The configuration is added to the settings for the parent slot type.
valueSelectionStrategy => Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex uses to return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the following values:    ORIGINAL_VALUE - Returns the value entered by the user, if the user value is similar to the slot value.    TOP_RESOLUTION - If there is a resolution list for the slot, return the first value in the resolution list as the slot type value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.   If you don't specify the valueSelectionStrategy, the default is ORIGINAL_VALUE.
