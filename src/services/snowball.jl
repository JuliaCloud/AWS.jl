serviceable area of your region. If the address is invalid or unsupported, then an

separately to create the jobs for each of these nodes. The cluster does not ship until
these five node jobs have been created.

# Arguments
- `address_id`: The ID for the address that you want the cluster shipped to.
- `job_type`: The type of job for this cluster. Currently, the only job type supported for
  clusters is LOCAL_USE.

  dictate how soon you'll get each Snowball Edge device, rather it represents how quickly
  each device moves to its destination while in transit. Regional shipping speeds are as
