    CreateCluster()

Creates an empty cluster. Each cluster supports five nodes. You use the CreateJob action separately to create the jobs for each of these nodes. The cluster does not ship until these five node jobs have been created.

Required Parameters
{
  "AddressId": "The ID for the address that you want the cluster shipped to.",
  "ShippingOption": "The shipping speed for each node in this cluster. This speed doesn't dictate how soon you'll get each Snowball Edge device, rather it represents how quickly each device moves to its destination while in transit. Regional shipping speeds are as follows:   In Australia, you have access to express shipping. Typically, devices shipped express are delivered in about a day.   In the European Union (EU), you have access to express shipping. Typically, Snowball Edges shipped express are delivered in about a day. In addition, most countries in the EU have access to standard shipping, which typically takes less than a week, one way.   In India, Snowball Edges are delivered in one to seven days.   In the US, you have access to one-day shipping and two-day shipping.  ",
  "Resources": "The resources associated with the cluster job. These resources include Amazon S3 buckets and optional AWS Lambda functions written in the Python language. ",

Optional Parameters

    ListCompatibleImages()

This action returns a list of the different Amazon EC2 Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are owned by your AWS account that would be supported for use on a Snowball Edge device.

Optional Parameters

    CreateAddress()

    CreateJob()

Creates a job to import or export data between Amazon S3 and your on-premises data center. Your AWS account must have the right trust policies and permissions in place to create a job for Snowball.

Optional Parameters
{
  "TaxDocuments": "The tax documents required in your AWS Region.",

    UpdateCluster()

While a cluster's ClusterState value is in the AwaitingQuorum state, you can update some of the information associated with a cluster. Once the cluster changes to a different job state, usually 60 minutes after the cluster being created, this action is no longer available.

Required Parameters
{

    GetJobUnlockCode()

Returns the UnlockCode code value for the specified job. A particular UnlockCode value can be accessed for up to 90 days after the associated job has been created. The UnlockCode value is a 29-character code with 25 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens. This code is used to decrypt the manifest file when it is passed along with the manifest to the Snowball through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time. As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of the UnlockCode in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snowball associated with that job.

Required Parameters
{
  "JobId": "The ID for the job that you want to get the UnlockCode value for, for example JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000."

    GetJobManifest()

Returns a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file associated with the specified JobId value. You can access the manifest file for up to 60 minutes after this request has been made. To access the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed, you'll have to make another call to the GetJobManifest action. The manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job enters the WithCustomer status. The manifest is decrypted by using the UnlockCode code value, when you pass both values to the Snowball through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time. As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an UnlockCode value in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snowball associated with that job.
