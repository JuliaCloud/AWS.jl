    create_call_analytics_category(category_name, rules)
    create_call_analytics_category(category_name, rules, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new Call Analytics category. All categories are automatically applied to your
Call Analytics transcriptions. Note that in order to apply categories to your
transcriptions, you must create them before submitting your transcription request, as
categories cannot be applied retroactively. When creating a new category, you can use the
InputType parameter to label the category as a batch category (POST_CALL) or a streaming
category (REAL_TIME). Batch categories can only be applied to batch transcriptions and
streaming categories can only be applied to streaming transcriptions. If you do not include
InputType, your category is created as a batch category by default. Call Analytics
categories are composed of rules. For each category, you must create between 1 and 20
rules. Rules can include these parameters: , , , and . To update an existing category, see
. To learn more about Call Analytics categories, see Creating categories for batch
transcriptions and Creating categories for streaming transcriptions.

# Arguments
- `category_name`: A unique name, chosen by you, for your Call Analytics category. It's
  helpful to use a detailed naming system that will make sense to you in the future. For
  example, it's better to use sentiment-positive-last30seconds for a category over a generic
  name like test-category. Category names are case sensitive.
- `rules`: Rules define a Call Analytics category. When creating a new category, you must
  create between 1 and 20 rules for that category. For each rule, you specify a filter you
  want applied to the attributes of a call. For example, you can choose a sentiment filter
  that detects if a customer's sentiment was positive during the last 30 seconds of the call.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"InputType"`: Choose whether you want to create a streaming or a batch category for your
  Call Analytics transcription. Specifying POST_CALL assigns your category to batch
  transcriptions; categories with this input type cannot be applied to streaming (real-time)
  transcriptions. Specifying REAL_TIME assigns your category to streaming transcriptions;
  categories with this input type cannot be applied to batch (post-call) transcriptions. If
  you do not include InputType, your category is created as a batch category by default.

    create_language_model(base_model_name, input_data_config, language_code, model_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new custom language model. When creating a new custom language model, you must
specify:   If you want a Wideband (audio sample rates over 16,000 Hz) or Narrowband (audio
sample rates under 16,000 Hz) base model   The location of your training and tuning files
(this must be an Amazon S3 URI)   The language of your model   A unique name for your model


# Arguments
- `base_model_name`: The Amazon Transcribe standard language model, or base model, used to
  create your custom language model. Amazon Transcribe offers two options for base models:
  Wideband and Narrowband. If the audio you want to transcribe has a sample rate of 16,000 Hz
  or greater, choose WideBand. To transcribe audio with a sample rate less than 16,000 Hz,
  choose NarrowBand.
- `input_data_config`: Contains the Amazon S3 location of the training data you want to use
  to create a new custom language model, and permissions to access this location. When using
  InputDataConfig, you must include these sub-parameters: S3Uri, which is the Amazon S3
  location of your training data, and DataAccessRoleArn, which is the Amazon Resource Name
  (ARN) of the role that has permission to access your specified Amazon S3 location. You can
  optionally include TuningDataS3Uri, which is the Amazon S3 location of your tuning data. If
  you specify different Amazon S3 locations for training and tuning data, the ARN you use
  must have permissions to access both locations.
- `language_code`: The language code that represents the language of your model. Each
  custom language model must contain terms in only one language, and the language you select
  for your custom language model must match the language of your training and tuning data.
  For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the
  Supported languages table. Note that US English (en-US) is the only language supported with
  Amazon Transcribe Medical. A custom language model can only be used to transcribe files in
  the same language as the model. For example, if you create a custom language model using US
  English (en-US), you can only apply this model to files that contain English audio.
- `model_name`: A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom language model. This name is
  case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services
  account. If you try to create a new custom language model with the same name as an existing
  custom language model, you get a ConflictException error.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Tags"`: Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new
  custom language model at the time you create this new model. To learn more about using tags
  with Amazon Transcribe, refer to Tagging resources.

    create_medical_vocabulary(language_code, vocabulary_file_uri, vocabulary_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new custom medical vocabulary. Before creating a new custom medical vocabulary,
you must first upload a text file that contains your new entries, phrases, and terms into
an Amazon S3 bucket. Note that this differs from , where you can include a list of terms
within your request using the Phrases flag; CreateMedicalVocabulary does not support the
Phrases flag. Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for
that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary request
fails. Refer to Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies to get the character set for your
language. For more information, see Custom vocabularies.

# Arguments
- `language_code`: The language code that represents the language of the entries in your
  custom vocabulary. US English (en-US) is the only language supported with Amazon Transcribe
  Medical.
- `vocabulary_file_uri`: The Amazon S3 location (URI) of the text file that contains your
  custom medical vocabulary. The URI must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the
  resource you're calling. Here's an example URI path:
  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-file.txt
- `vocabulary_name`: A unique name, chosen by you, for your new custom medical vocabulary.

    create_vocabulary(language_code, vocabulary_name)
    create_vocabulary(language_code, vocabulary_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new custom vocabulary. When creating a new custom vocabulary, you can either
upload a text file that contains your new entries, phrases, and terms into an Amazon S3
bucket and include the URI in your request. Or you can include a list of terms directly in
your request using the Phrases flag. Each language has a character set that contains all
allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your
custom vocabulary request fails. Refer to Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies to get the
character set for your language. For more information, see Custom vocabularies.

# Arguments
- `language_code`: The language code that represents the language of the entries in your
  custom vocabulary. Each custom vocabulary must contain terms in only one language. A custom
  vocabulary can only be used to transcribe files in the same language as the custom
  vocabulary. For example, if you create a custom vocabulary using US English (en-US), you
  can only apply this custom vocabulary to files that contain English audio. For a list of
  supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the Supported languages
  table.
- `vocabulary_name`: A unique name, chosen by you, for your new custom vocabulary. This
  name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web

  existing custom vocabulary, you get a ConflictException error.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Phrases"`: Use this parameter if you want to create your custom vocabulary by including
  all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your request. The other option for
  creating your custom vocabulary is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to
  an Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file using the VocabularyFileUri
  parameter. Note that if you include Phrases in your request, you cannot use
  VocabularyFileUri; you must choose one or the other. Each language has a character set that
  contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported
  characters, your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to Character Sets for Custom
  Vocabularies to get the character set for your language.

    start_call_analytics_job(call_analytics_job_name, media)
    start_call_analytics_job(call_analytics_job_name, media, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Transcribes the audio from a customer service call and applies any additional Request
Parameters you choose to include in your request. In addition to many standard
transcription features, Call Analytics provides you with call characteristics, call
summarization, speaker sentiment, and optional redaction of your text transcript and your
audio file. You can also apply custom categories to flag specified conditions. To learn
more about these features and insights, refer to Analyzing call center audio with Call
Analytics. If you want to apply categories to your Call Analytics job, you must create them
before submitting your job request. Categories cannot be retroactively applied to a job. To
create a new category, use the operation. To learn more about Call Analytics categories,
see Creating categories for batch transcriptions and Creating categories for streaming
transcriptions. To make a StartCallAnalyticsJob request, you must first upload your media
file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file
using the Media parameter. You must include the following parameters in your
StartCallAnalyticsJob request:    region: The Amazon Web Services Region where you are
making your request. For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Amazon
Transcribe, refer to Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas.    CallAnalyticsJobName: A
custom name that you create for your transcription job that's unique within your Amazon Web
Services account.    DataAccessRoleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that
has permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files.    Media
(MediaFileUri or RedactedMediaFileUri): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.    With
Call Analytics, you can redact the audio contained in your media file by including
RedactedMediaFileUri, instead of MediaFileUri, to specify the location of your input audio.
If you choose to redact your audio, you can find your redacted media at the location
specified in the RedactedMediaFileUri field of your response.

# Arguments
- `call_analytics_job_name`: A unique name, chosen by you, for your Call Analytics job.
  This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web
  Services account. If you try to create a new job with the same name as an existing job, you
  get a ConflictException error.
- `media`: Describes the Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to use in your Call
  Analytics request.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ChannelDefinitions"`: Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel.
  For example, if your agent is the first participant to speak, you would set ChannelId to 0
  (to indicate the first channel) and ParticipantRole to AGENT (to indicate that it's the
  agent speaking).
- `"DataAccessRoleArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions
  to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files. If the role that you specify
  doesn’t have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 location, your
  request fails. IAM role ARNs have the format
  arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path. For example:
  arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin. For more information, see IAM ARNs.
- `"OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId"`: The KMS key you want to use to encrypt your Call Analytics
  output. If using a key located in the current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify
  your KMS key in one of four ways:   Use the KMS key ID itself. For example,
  1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example,
  alias/ExampleAlias.   Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For example,
  arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for
  the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If
  using a key located in a different Amazon Web Services account than the current Amazon Web
  Services account, you can specify your KMS key in one of two ways:   Use the ARN for the
  KMS key ID. For example,
  arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for
  the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If you
  don't specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key
  (SSE-S3). If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also specify an output
  location using the OutputLocation parameter. Note that the user making the request must
  have permission to use the specified KMS key.
- `"OutputLocation"`: The Amazon S3 location where you want your Call Analytics
  transcription output stored. You can use any of the following formats to specify the output
  location:   s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET   s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-output-folder/
  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-output-folder/my-call-analytics-job.json   Unless you specify a
  file name (option 3), the name of your output file has a default value that matches the
  name you specified for your transcription job using the CallAnalyticsJobName parameter. You
  can specify a KMS key to encrypt your output using the OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId parameter.
  If you don't specify a KMS key, Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key for
  server-side encryption. If you don't specify OutputLocation, your transcript is placed in a
  service-managed Amazon S3 bucket and you are provided with a URI to access your transcript.
- `"Settings"`: Specify additional optional settings in your request, including content
  redaction; allows you to apply custom language models, vocabulary filters, and custom
  vocabularies to your Call Analytics job.

Transcribes the audio from a medical dictation or conversation and applies any additional
Request Parameters you choose to include in your request. In addition to many standard
transcription features, Amazon Transcribe Medical provides you with a robust medical
vocabulary and, optionally, content identification, which adds flags to personal health
information (PHI). To learn more about these features, refer to How Amazon Transcribe
Medical works. To make a StartMedicalTranscriptionJob request, you must first upload your
media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the S3 location of the file using
the Media parameter. You must include the following parameters in your
StartMedicalTranscriptionJob request:    region: The Amazon Web Services Region where you
are making your request. For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Amazon
Transcribe, refer to Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas.
MedicalTranscriptionJobName: A custom name you create for your transcription job that is
unique within your Amazon Web Services account.    Media (MediaFileUri): The Amazon S3
location of your media file.    LanguageCode: This must be en-US.    OutputBucketName: The
Amazon S3 bucket where you want your transcript stored. If you want your output stored in a
sub-folder of this bucket, you must also include OutputKey.    Specialty: This must be
PRIMARYCARE.    Type: Choose whether your audio is a conversation or a dictation.

# Arguments
- `language_code`: The language code that represents the language spoken in the input media
  file. US English (en-US) is the only valid value for medical transcription jobs. Any other
  value you enter for language code results in a BadRequestException error.
- `media`:
- `medical_transcription_job_name`: A unique name, chosen by you, for your medical
  transcription job. The name that you specify is also used as the default name of your
  transcription output file. If you want to specify a different name for your transcription
  output, use the OutputKey parameter. This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces,
  and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new job
  with the same name as an existing job, you get a ConflictException error.
- `output_bucket_name`: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your medical
  transcription output stored. Do not include the S3:// prefix of the specified bucket. If
  you want your output to go to a sub-folder of this bucket, specify it using the OutputKey
  parameter; OutputBucketName only accepts the name of a bucket. For example, if you want
  your output stored in S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET, set OutputBucketName to DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.
  However, if you want your output stored in S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/, set
  OutputBucketName to DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET and OutputKey to test-files/. Note that Amazon
  Transcribe must have permission to use the specified location. You can change Amazon S3
  permissions using the Amazon Web Services Management Console. See also Permissions Required
  for IAM User Roles.
- `specialty`: Specify the predominant medical specialty represented in your media. For
  batch transcriptions, PRIMARYCARE is the only valid value. If you require additional
  specialties, refer to .
- `type`: Specify whether your input media contains only one person (DICTATION) or contains
  a conversation between two people (CONVERSATION). For example, DICTATION could be used for
  a medical professional wanting to transcribe voice memos; CONVERSATION could be used for
  transcribing the doctor-patient dialogue during the patient's office visit.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ContentIdentificationType"`: Labels all personal health information (PHI) identified in
  your transcript. For more information, see Identifying personal health information (PHI) in
  a transcription.
- `"KMSEncryptionContext"`: A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as
  encryption context pairs, that provide an added layer of security for your data. For more
  information, see KMS encryption context and Asymmetric keys in KMS.
- `"MediaFormat"`: Specify the format of your input media file.
- `"MediaSampleRateHertz"`: The sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in your input
  media file. If you don't specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe Medical
  determines it for you. If you specify the sample rate, it must match the rate detected by
  Amazon Transcribe Medical; if there's a mismatch between the value that you specify and the
  value detected, your job fails. Therefore, in most cases, it's advised to omit
  MediaSampleRateHertz and let Amazon Transcribe Medical determine the sample rate.
- `"OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId"`: The KMS key you want to use to encrypt your medical
  transcription output. If using a key located in the current Amazon Web Services account,
  you can specify your KMS key in one of four ways:   Use the KMS key ID itself. For example,
  1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example,
  alias/ExampleAlias.   Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For example,
  arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for
  the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If
  using a key located in a different Amazon Web Services account than the current Amazon Web
  Services account, you can specify your KMS key in one of two ways:   Use the ARN for the
  KMS key ID. For example,
  arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for
  the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If you
  don't specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key
  (SSE-S3). If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also specify an output
  location using the OutputLocation parameter. Note that the user making the request must
  have permission to use the specified KMS key.
- `"OutputKey"`: Use in combination with OutputBucketName to specify the output location of
  your transcript and, optionally, a unique name for your output file. The default name for
  your transcription output is the same as the name you specified for your medical
  transcription job (MedicalTranscriptionJobName). Here are some examples of how you can use
  OutputKey:   If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName and
  'my-transcript.json' as the OutputKey, your transcription output path is
  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript.json.   If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as
  the MedicalTranscriptionJobName, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName, and
  'my-transcript' as the OutputKey, your transcription output path is
  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json.   If you specify
  'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName and 'test-files/my-transcript.json' as the
  OutputKey, your transcription output path is
  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript.json.   If you specify
  'my-first-transcription' as the MedicalTranscriptionJobName, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the
  OutputBucketName, and 'test-files/my-transcript' as the OutputKey, your transcription
  output path is
  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json.   If you
  specify the name of an Amazon S3 bucket sub-folder that doesn't exist, one is created for
  you.
- `"Settings"`: Specify additional optional settings in your request, including channel
  identification, alternative transcriptions, and speaker partitioning. You can use that to
  apply custom vocabularies to your transcription job.
- `"Tags"`: Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new
  medical transcription job at the time you start this new job. To learn more about using
  tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to Tagging resources.

Transcribes the audio from a media file and applies any additional Request Parameters you
choose to include in your request. To make a StartTranscriptionJob request, you must first
upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3
location of the file using the Media parameter. You must include the following parameters
in your StartTranscriptionJob request:    region: The Amazon Web Services Region where you
are making your request. For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Amazon
Transcribe, refer to Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas.    TranscriptionJobName: A
custom name you create for your transcription job that is unique within your Amazon Web
Services account.    Media (MediaFileUri): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.   One
of LanguageCode, IdentifyLanguage, or IdentifyMultipleLanguages: If you know the language
of your media file, specify it using the LanguageCode parameter; you can find all valid
language codes in the Supported languages table. If you don't know the languages spoken in
your media, use either IdentifyLanguage or IdentifyMultipleLanguages and let Amazon
Transcribe identify the languages for you.

# Arguments
- `media`: Describes the Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to use in your
  request.
- `transcription_job_name`: A unique name, chosen by you, for your transcription job. The
  name that you specify is also used as the default name of your transcription output file.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ContentRedaction"`: Makes it possible to redact or flag specified personally
  identifiable information (PII) in your transcript. If you use ContentRedaction, you must
  also include the sub-parameters: PiiEntityTypes, RedactionOutput, and RedactionType.
- `"IdentifyLanguage"`: Enables automatic language identification in your transcription job
  request. Use this parameter if your media file contains only one language. If your media
  contains multiple languages, use IdentifyMultipleLanguages instead. If you include
  IdentifyLanguage, you can optionally include a list of language codes, using
  LanguageOptions, that you think may be present in your media file. Including
  LanguageOptions restricts IdentifyLanguage to only the language options that you specify,
  which can improve transcription accuracy. If you want to apply a custom language model, a
  custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter to your automatic language identification
  request, include LanguageIdSettings with the relevant sub-parameters (VocabularyName,
  LanguageModelName, and VocabularyFilterName). If you include LanguageIdSettings, also
  include LanguageOptions. Note that you must include one of LanguageCode, IdentifyLanguage,
  or IdentifyMultipleLanguages in your request. If you include more than one of these
  parameters, your transcription job fails.
- `"IdentifyMultipleLanguages"`: Enables automatic multi-language identification in your
  transcription job request. Use this parameter if your media file contains more than one
  language. If your media contains only one language, use IdentifyLanguage instead. If you
  include IdentifyMultipleLanguages, you can optionally include a list of language codes,

  LanguageOptions restricts IdentifyLanguage to only the language options that you specify,
  which can improve transcription accuracy. If you want to apply a custom vocabulary or a
  custom vocabulary filter to your automatic language identification request, include
  LanguageIdSettings with the relevant sub-parameters (VocabularyName and
  VocabularyFilterName). If you include LanguageIdSettings, also include LanguageOptions.
  Note that you must include one of LanguageCode, IdentifyLanguage, or
  IdentifyMultipleLanguages in your request. If you include more than one of these
  parameters, your transcription job fails.
- `"JobExecutionSettings"`: Makes it possible to control how your transcription job is
  processed. Currently, the only JobExecutionSettings modification you can choose is enabling
  job queueing using the AllowDeferredExecution sub-parameter. If you include
  JobExecutionSettings in your request, you must also include the sub-parameters:
  AllowDeferredExecution and DataAccessRoleArn.
- `"KMSEncryptionContext"`: A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as
  encryption context pairs, that provide an added layer of security for your data. For more
  information, see KMS encryption context and Asymmetric keys in KMS.
- `"LanguageCode"`: The language code that represents the language spoken in the input
  media file. If you're unsure of the language spoken in your media file, consider using
  IdentifyLanguage or IdentifyMultipleLanguages to enable automatic language identification.
  Note that you must include one of LanguageCode, IdentifyLanguage, or
  IdentifyMultipleLanguages in your request. If you include more than one of these
  parameters, your transcription job fails. For a list of supported languages and their
  associated language codes, refer to the Supported languages table.  To transcribe speech in
  Modern Standard Arabic (ar-SA), your media file must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000
  Hz or higher.
- `"LanguageIdSettings"`: If using automatic language identification in your request and
  you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary
  filter, include LanguageIdSettings with the relevant sub-parameters (VocabularyName,
  LanguageModelName, and VocabularyFilterName). Note that multi-language identification
  (IdentifyMultipleLanguages) doesn't support custom language models.  LanguageIdSettings
  supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated
  custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes
  that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom
  vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters. It's recommended that you include
  LanguageOptions when using LanguageIdSettings to ensure that the correct language dialect
  is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in en-US but Amazon
  Transcribe determines that the language spoken in your media is en-AU, your custom
  vocabulary is not applied to your transcription. If you include LanguageOptions and include
  en-US as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary is applied to your
  transcription. If you want to include a custom language model with your request but do not
  want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the
  LanguageModelName sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom
  vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but do not want to use automatic language
  identification, use instead the  parameter with the VocabularyName or VocabularyFilterName
  (or both) sub-parameter.
- `"LanguageOptions"`: You can specify two or more language codes that represent the
  languages you think may be present in your media. Including more than five is not
  recommended. If you're unsure what languages are present, do not include this parameter. If
  you include LanguageOptions in your request, you must also include IdentifyLanguage. For
  more information, refer to Supported languages. To transcribe speech in Modern Standard
  Arabic (ar-SA), your media file must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or higher.
- `"MediaFormat"`: Specify the format of your input media file.
- `"MediaSampleRateHertz"`: The sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in your input
  media file. If you don't specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe determines it for
  you. If you specify the sample rate, it must match the rate detected by Amazon Transcribe.
  If there's a mismatch between the value that you specify and the value detected, your job
  fails. In most cases, you can omit MediaSampleRateHertz and let Amazon Transcribe determine
  the sample rate.
- `"ModelSettings"`: Specify the custom language model you want to include with your
  transcription job. If you include ModelSettings in your request, you must include the
  LanguageModelName sub-parameter. For more information, see Custom language models.
- `"OutputBucketName"`: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your transcription
  output stored. Do not include the S3:// prefix of the specified bucket. If you want your
  output to go to a sub-folder of this bucket, specify it using the OutputKey parameter;
  OutputBucketName only accepts the name of a bucket. For example, if you want your output
  stored in S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET, set OutputBucketName to DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET. However, if
  you want your output stored in S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/, set OutputBucketName to
  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET and OutputKey to test-files/. Note that Amazon Transcribe must have
  permission to use the specified location. You can change Amazon S3 permissions using the
  Amazon Web Services Management Console. See also Permissions Required for IAM User Roles.
  If you don't specify OutputBucketName, your transcript is placed in a service-managed
  Amazon S3 bucket and you are provided with a URI to access your transcript.
- `"OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId"`: The KMS key you want to use to encrypt your transcription
  output. If using a key located in the current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify
  your KMS key in one of four ways:   Use the KMS key ID itself. For example,
  1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example,
  alias/ExampleAlias.   Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For example,
  arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for
  the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If
  using a key located in a different Amazon Web Services account than the current Amazon Web
  Services account, you can specify your KMS key in one of two ways:   Use the ARN for the
  KMS key ID. For example,
  arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for
  the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If you
  don't specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key
  (SSE-S3). If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also specify an output
  location using the OutputLocation parameter. Note that the user making the request must
  have permission to use the specified KMS key.
- `"OutputKey"`: Use in combination with OutputBucketName to specify the output location of
  your transcript and, optionally, a unique name for your output file. The default name for
  your transcription output is the same as the name you specified for your transcription job
  (TranscriptionJobName). Here are some examples of how you can use OutputKey:   If you
  specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName and 'my-transcript.json' as the
  OutputKey, your transcription output path is s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript.json.
  If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the TranscriptionJobName, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET'
  as the OutputBucketName, and 'my-transcript' as the OutputKey, your transcription output
  path is s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json.   If you specify
  'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName and 'test-files/my-transcript.json' as the
  OutputKey, your transcription output path is
  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript.json.   If you specify
  'my-first-transcription' as the TranscriptionJobName, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the
  OutputBucketName, and 'test-files/my-transcript' as the OutputKey, your transcription
  output path is
  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json.   If you
  specify the name of an Amazon S3 bucket sub-folder that doesn't exist, one is created for
  you.
- `"Settings"`: Specify additional optional settings in your request, including channel
  identification, alternative transcriptions, speaker partitioning. You can use that to apply
  custom vocabularies and vocabulary filters. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a
  custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but do not want to use automatic
  language identification, use Settings with the VocabularyName or VocabularyFilterName (or
  both) sub-parameter. If you're using automatic language identification with your request
  and want to include a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary
  filter, use instead the  parameter with the LanguageModelName, VocabularyName or
  VocabularyFilterName sub-parameters.
- `"Subtitles"`: Produces subtitle files for your input media. You can specify WebVTT
  (*.vtt) and SubRip (*.srt) formats.
- `"Tags"`: Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new
  transcription job at the time you start this new job. To learn more about using tags with
  Amazon Transcribe, refer to Tagging resources.
