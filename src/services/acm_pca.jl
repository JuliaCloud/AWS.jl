    create_certificate_authority(certificate_authority_configuration, certificate_authority_type)
    create_certificate_authority(certificate_authority_configuration, certificate_authority_type, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must specify the CA
configuration, the certificate revocation list (CRL) configuration, the CA type, and an
optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA
configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA
private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information.
The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of
the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3
bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action
returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA. ACM Private CAA assets that are stored in
Amazon S3 can be protected with encryption. For more information, see Encrypting Your CRLs.
 Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you
specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to write to the
bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see Configure Access to ACM
Private CA.

# Arguments
- `certificate_authority_configuration`: Name and bit size of the private key algorithm,
  the name of the signing algorithm, and X.500 certificate subject information.
- `certificate_authority_type`: The type of the certificate authority.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"IdempotencyToken"`: Custom string that can be used to distinguish between calls to the
  CreateCertificateAuthority action. Idempotency tokens for CreateCertificateAuthority time
  out after five minutes. Therefore, if you call CreateCertificateAuthority multiple times
  with the same idempotency token within five minutes, ACM Private CA recognizes that you are
  requesting only certificate authority and will issue only one. If you change the
  idempotency token for each call, PCA recognizes that you are requesting multiple
  certificate authorities.
- `"RevocationConfiguration"`: Contains a Boolean value that you can use to enable a
  certification revocation list (CRL) for the CA, the name of the S3 bucket to which ACM
  Private CA will write the CRL, and an optional CNAME alias that you can use to hide the
  name of your bucket in the CRL Distribution Points extension of your CA certificate. For
  more information, see the CrlConfiguration structure.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs that will be attached to the new private CA. You can associate
  up to 50 tags with a private CA. For information using tags with IAM to manage permissions,
  see Controlling Access Using IAM Tags.

    create_permission(actions, certificate_authority_arn, principal)
    create_permission(actions, certificate_authority_arn, principal, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Grants one or more permissions on a private CA to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service
principal (acm.amazonaws.com). These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM
certificates that reside in the same AWS account as the CA. You can list current
permissions with the ListPermissions action and revoke them with the DeletePermission
action.  About Permissions    If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in
the same account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to carry out
automatic certificate renewals.   For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM
service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.   If the
private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot
be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a
resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information,
see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA.

# Arguments
- `actions`: The actions that the specified AWS service principal can use. These include
  IssueCertificate, GetCertificate, and ListPermissions.
- `certificate_authority_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA that grants the
  permissions. You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action. This
  must have the following form:
  arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 .

    delete_certificate_authority(certificate_authority_arn)
    delete_certificate_authority(certificate_authority_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Amazon Resource Name
(ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the
ListCertificateAuthorities action.   Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and
certificates below it in your CA hierarchy.  Before you can delete a CA that you have
created and activated, you must disable it. To do this, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority
action and set the CertificateAuthorityStatus parameter to DISABLED.  Additionally, you can
delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is
CREATING). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported
the signed certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is
PENDING_CERTIFICATE).  When you successfully call DeleteCertificateAuthority, the CA's
status changes to DELETED. However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until the
restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the
PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set
the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The DescribeCertificateAuthority action returns the time
remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the DELETED state. To restore an
eligible CA, call the RestoreCertificateAuthority action.

# Arguments
- `certificate_authority_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you
  called CreateCertificateAuthority. This must have the following form:
  arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 .

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

Revokes permissions on a private CA granted to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service
principal (acm.amazonaws.com).  These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM
certificates that reside in the same AWS account as the CA. If you revoke these
permissions, ACM will no longer renew the affected certificates automatically. Permissions

    delete_policy(resource_arn)
    delete_policy(resource_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deletes the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. Deletion will remove any access
that the policy has granted. If there is no policy attached to the private CA, this action
will return successful. If you delete a policy that was applied through AWS Resource Access
Manager (RAM), the CA will be removed from all shares in which it was included.  The AWS
Certificate Manager Service Linked Role that the policy supports is not affected when you
delete the policy.  The current policy can be shown with GetPolicy and updated with
PutPolicy.  About Policies    A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer
account, to AWS Organizations, or to an AWS Organizations unit. Policies are under the
control of a CA administrator. For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with
ACM Private CA.   A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM
certificates signed by a CA in another account.   For ACM to manage automatic renewal of
these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows
the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the ACM
Private CA policy. For more information, see Using a Service Linked Role with ACM.
Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information,
see Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access.

# Arguments

Imports a signed private CA certificate into ACM Private CA. This action is used when you
are using a chain of trust whose root is located outside ACM Private CA. Before you can
call this action, the following preparations must in place:   In ACM Private CA, call the
CreateCertificateAuthority action to create the private CA that you plan to back with the
imported certificate.   Call the GetCertificateAuthorityCsr action to generate a
certificate signing request (CSR).   Sign the CSR using a root or intermediate CA hosted by
either an on-premises PKI hierarchy or by a commercial CA.   Create a certificate chain and
copy the signed certificate and the certificate chain to your working directory.   ACM
Private CA supports three scenarios for installing a CA certificate:   Installing a
certificate for a root CA hosted by ACM Private CA.   Installing a subordinate CA
certificate whose parent authority is hosted by ACM Private CA.   Installing a subordinate
CA certificate whose parent authority is externally hosted.   The following additional
requirements apply when you import a CA certificate.   Only a self-signed certificate can
be imported as a root CA.   A self-signed certificate cannot be imported as a subordinate
CA.   Your certificate chain must not include the private CA certificate that you are
importing.   Your root CA must be the last certificate in your chain. The subordinate
certificate, if any, that your root CA signed must be next to last. The subordinate
certificate signed by the preceding subordinate CA must come next, and so on until your
chain is built.    The chain must be PEM-encoded.   The maximum allowed size of a
certificate is 32 KB.   The maximum allowed size of a certificate chain is 2 MB.
Enforcement of Critical Constraints  ACM Private CA allows the following extensions to be
marked critical in the imported CA certificate or chain.   Basic constraints (must be
marked critical)   Subject alternative names   Key usage   Extended key usage   Authority
key identifier   Subject key identifier   Issuer alternative name   Subject directory
attributes   Subject information access   Certificate policies   Policy mappings   Inhibit

in an imported CA certificate or chain.   Name constraints   Policy constraints   CRL
distribution points   Authority information access   Freshest CRL   Any other extension

# Arguments
- `certificate`: The PEM-encoded certificate for a private CA. This may be a self-signed

  private key.   openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout
  private/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr  If you have a configuration file,
  you can then use the following OpenSSL command. The usr_cert block in the configuration
  file contains your X509 version 3 extensions.   openssl req -new -config openssl_rsa.cnf
  -extensions usr_cert -newkey rsa:2048 -days -365 -keyout private/test_cert_priv_key.pem
  -out csr/test_cert_.csr  Note: A CSR must provide either a subject name or a subject
  alternative name or the request will be rejected.
- `signing_algorithm`: The name of the algorithm that will be used to sign the certificate
  to be issued.  This parameter should not be confused with the SigningAlgorithm parameter
  used to sign a CSR in the CreateCertificateAuthority action.
- `validity`: Information describing the end of the validity period of the certificate.
  This parameter sets the “Not After” date for the certificate. Certificate validity is
  the period of time during which a certificate is valid. Validity can be expressed as an
  explicit date and time when the certificate expires, or as a span of time after issuance,
  stated in days, months, or years. For more information, see Validity in RFC 5280.  This
  value is unaffected when ValidityNotBefore is also specified. For example, if Validity is
  set to 20 days in the future, the certificate will expire 20 days from issuance time
  regardless of the ValidityNotBefore value. The end of the validity period configured on a
  certificate must not exceed the limit set on its parents in the CA hierarchy.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ApiPassthrough"`: Specifies X.509 certificate information to be included in the issued
  certificate. An APIPassthrough or APICSRPassthrough template variant must be selected, or
  else this parameter is ignored. For more information about using these templates, see
  Understanding Certificate Templates. If conflicting or duplicate certificate information is
  supplied during certificate issuance, ACM Private CA applies order of operation rules to
  determine what information is used.
- `"IdempotencyToken"`: Alphanumeric string that can be used to distinguish between calls
  to the IssueCertificate action. Idempotency tokens for IssueCertificate time out after one
  minute. Therefore, if you call IssueCertificate multiple times with the same idempotency
  token within one minute, ACM Private CA recognizes that you are requesting only one
  certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, PCA
  recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.
- `"TemplateArn"`: Specifies a custom configuration template to use when issuing a
  certificate. If this parameter is not provided, ACM Private CA defaults to the
  EndEntityCertificate/V1 template. For CA certificates, you should choose the shortest path
  length that meets your needs. The path length is indicated by the PathLenN portion of the
  ARN, where N is the CA depth. Note: The CA depth configured on a subordinate CA certificate
  must not exceed the limit set by its parents in the CA hierarchy. For a list of TemplateArn
  values supported by ACM Private CA, see Understanding Certificate Templates.
- `"ValidityNotBefore"`: Information describing the start of the validity period of the
  certificate. This parameter sets the “Not Before\" date for the certificate. By default,
  when issuing a certificate, ACM Private CA sets the \"Not Before\" date to the issuance
  time minus 60 minutes. This compensates for clock inconsistencies across computer systems.
  The ValidityNotBefore parameter can be used to customize the “Not Before” value.
  Unlike the Validity parameter, the ValidityNotBefore parameter is optional. The
  ValidityNotBefore value is expressed as an explicit date and time, using the Validity type
  value ABSOLUTE. For more information, see Validity in this API reference and Validity in
  RFC 5280.

    list_permissions(certificate_authority_arn)
    list_permissions(certificate_authority_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

List all permissions on a private CA, if any, granted to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).  These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM
certificates that reside in the same AWS account as the CA.  Permissions can be granted
with the CreatePermission action and revoked with the DeletePermission action.  About
Permissions    If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account,
you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic
certificate renewals.   For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service
principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.   If the private CA
and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to
enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based
policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see Using a
Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA.

# Arguments
- `certificate_authority_arn`: The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to
  inspect. You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action. This must
  be of the form:
  arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

    put_policy(policy, resource_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Attaches a resource-based policy to a private CA.  A policy can also be applied by sharing
a private CA through AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). For more information, see Attach a
Policy for Cross-Account Access. The policy can be displayed with GetPolicy and removed
with DeletePolicy.  About Policies    A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS
customer account, to AWS Organizations, or to an AWS Organizations unit. Policies are under
the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy
with ACM Private CA.   A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue
ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.   For ACM to manage automatic renewal
of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR
allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against
the ACM Private CA policy. For more information, see Using a Service Linked Role with ACM.
 Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more
information, see Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access.

# Arguments
- `policy`: The path and file name of a JSON-formatted IAM policy to attach to the
  specified private CA resource. If this policy does not contain all required statements or
  if it includes any statement that is not allowed, the PutPolicy action returns an
  InvalidPolicyException. For information about IAM policy and statement structure, see
  Overview of JSON Policies.

    restore_certificate_authority(certificate_authority_arn)
    restore_certificate_authority(certificate_authority_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Restores a certificate authority (CA) that is in the DELETED state. You can restore a CA
during the period that you defined in the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter of the
DeleteCertificateAuthority action. Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not
specify a PermanentDeletionTimeInDays value, by default you can restore the CA at any time
in a 30 day period. You can check the time remaining in the restoration period of a private
CA in the DELETED state by calling the DescribeCertificateAuthority or
ListCertificateAuthorities actions. The status of a restored CA is set to its pre-deletion
status when the RestoreCertificateAuthority action returns. To change its status to ACTIVE,
call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action. If the private CA was in the
PENDING_CERTIFICATE state at deletion, you must use the
ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate action to import a certificate authority into the

    revoke_certificate(certificate_authority_arn, certificate_serial, revocation_reason)
    revoke_certificate(certificate_authority_arn, certificate_serial, revocation_reason, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Revokes a certificate that was issued inside ACM Private CA. If you enable a certificate
revocation list (CRL) when you create or update your private CA, information about the
revoked certificates will be included in the CRL. ACM Private CA writes the CRL to an S3
bucket that you specify. A CRL is typically updated approximately 30 minutes after a
certificate is revoked. If for any reason the CRL update fails, ACM Private CA attempts
makes further attempts every 15 minutes. With Amazon CloudWatch, you can create alarms for
the metrics CRLGenerated and MisconfiguredCRLBucket. For more information, see Supported
CloudWatch Metrics.  Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3
bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to
write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see Configure
Access to ACM Private CA.  ACM Private CA also writes revocation information to the audit
report. For more information, see CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport.  You cannot revoke
a root CA self-signed certificate.

- `certificate_serial`: Serial number of the certificate to be revoked. This must be in
  hexadecimal format. You can retrieve the serial number by calling GetCertificate with the
  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate you want and the ARN of your private CA. The
  GetCertificate action retrieves the certificate in the PEM format. You can use the
  following OpenSSL command to list the certificate in text format and copy the hexadecimal
  serial number.   openssl x509 -in file_path -text -noout  You can also copy the serial
  number from the console or use the DescribeCertificate action in the AWS Certificate
  Manager API Reference.
