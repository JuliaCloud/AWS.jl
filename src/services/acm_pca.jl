    CreateCertificateAuthority()

Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must specify the CA configuration, the certificate revocation list (CRL) configuration, the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA. ACM Private CAA assets that are stored in Amazon S3 can be protected with encryption. For more information, see Encrypting Your CRLs.  Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see Configure Access to ACM Private CA. 

# Required Parameters
- `CertificateAuthorityConfiguration`: Name and bit size of the private key algorithm, the name of the signing algorithm, and X.500 certificate subject information.
- `CertificateAuthorityType`: The type of the certificate authority.

# Optional Parameters
- `IdempotencyToken`: Alphanumeric string that can be used to distinguish between calls to CreateCertificateAuthority. For a given token, ACM Private CA creates exactly one CA. If you issue a subsequent call using the same token, ACM Private CA returns the ARN of the existing CA and takes no further action. If you change the idempotency token across multiple calls, ACM Private CA creates a unique CA for each unique token.
- `RevocationConfiguration`: Contains a Boolean value that you can use to enable a certification revocation list (CRL) for the CA, the name of the S3 bucket to which ACM Private CA will write the CRL, and an optional CNAME alias that you can use to hide the name of your bucket in the CRL Distribution Points extension of your CA certificate. For more information, see the CrlConfiguration structure. 
- `Tags`: Key-value pairs that will be attached to the new private CA. You can associate up to 50 tags with a private CA. For information using tags with IAM to manage permissions, see Controlling Access Using IAM Tags.

    CreatePermission()

Grants one or more permissions on a private CA to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com). These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM certificates that reside in the same AWS account as the CA. You can list current permissions with the ListPermissions action and revoke them with the DeletePermission action.  About Permissions    If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.   For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.   If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA.  

# Required Parameters
- `Actions`: The actions that the specified AWS service principal can use. These include IssueCertificate, GetCertificate, and ListPermissions.
- `CertificateAuthorityArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA that grants the permissions. You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action. This must have the following form:   arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 . 
- `Principal`: The AWS service or identity that receives the permission. At this time, the only valid principal is acm.amazonaws.com.

"""
    DeleteCertificateAuthority()

Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.   Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in your CA hierarchy.  Before you can delete a CA that you have created and activated, you must disable it. To do this, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action and set the CertificateAuthorityStatus parameter to DISABLED.  Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is CREATING). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is PENDING_CERTIFICATE).  When you successfully call DeleteCertificateAuthority, the CA's status changes to DELETED. However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The DescribeCertificateAuthority action returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the DELETED state. To restore an eligible CA, call the RestoreCertificateAuthority action.

# Required Parameters
- `CertificateAuthorityArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called CreateCertificateAuthority. This must have the following form:   arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 . 

# Optional Parameters

    DeletePermission()

Revokes permissions on a private CA granted to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).  These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM certificates that reside in the same AWS account as the CA. If you revoke these permissions, ACM will no longer renew the affected certificates automatically. Permissions can be granted with the CreatePermission action and listed with the ListPermissions action.   About Permissions    If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.

    DeletePolicy()

Deletes the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. Deletion will remove any access that the policy has granted. If there is no policy attached to the private CA, this action will return successful. If you delete a policy that was applied through AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM), the CA will be removed from all shares in which it was included.  The AWS Certificate Manager Service Linked Role that the policy supports is not affected when you delete the policy.  The current policy can be shown with GetPolicy and updated with PutPolicy.  About Policies    A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to AWS Organizations, or to an AWS Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA.   A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.   For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the ACM Private CA policy. For more information, see Using a Service Linked Role with ACM.   Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see Using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) with ACM Private CA.

    ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate()

Imports a signed private CA certificate into ACM Private CA. This action is used when you are using a chain of trust whose root is located outside ACM Private CA. Before you can call this action, the following preparations must in place:   In ACM Private CA, call the CreateCertificateAuthority action to create the private CA that that you plan to back with the imported certificate.   Call the GetCertificateAuthorityCsr action to generate a certificate signing request (CSR).   Sign the CSR using a root or intermediate CA hosted by either an on-premises PKI hierarchy or by a commercial CA.   Create a certificate chain and copy the signed certificate and the certificate chain to your working directory.   The following requirements apply when you import a CA certificate.   You cannot import a non-self-signed certificate for use as a root CA.   You cannot import a self-signed certificate for use as a subordinate CA.   Your certificate chain must not include the private CA certificate that you are importing.   Your ACM Private CA-hosted or on-premises CA certificate must be the last certificate in your chain. The subordinate certificate, if any, that your root CA signed must be next to last. The subordinate certificate signed by the preceding subordinate CA must come next, and so on until your chain is built.    The chain must be PEM-encoded.   The maximum allowed size of a certificate is 32 KB.   The maximum allowed size of a certificate chain is 2 MB.

    IssueCertificate()

Uses your private certificate authority (CA), or one that has been shared with you, to issue a client certificate. This action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate. You can retrieve the certificate by calling the GetCertificate action and specifying the ARN.   You cannot use the ACM ListCertificateAuthorities action to retrieve the ARNs of the certificates that you issue by using ACM Private CA. 

# Required Parameters
- `CertificateAuthorityArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called CreateCertificateAuthority. This must be of the form:  arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012  
- `Csr`: The certificate signing request (CSR) for the certificate you want to issue. You can use the following OpenSSL command to create the CSR and a 2048 bit RSA private key.   openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout private/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr  If you have a configuration file, you can use the following OpenSSL command. The usr_cert block in the configuration file contains your X509 version 3 extensions.   openssl req -new -config openssl_rsa.cnf -extensions usr_cert -newkey rsa:2048 -days -365 -keyout private/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr  Note: A CSR must provide either a subject name or a subject alternative name or the request will be rejected. 
- `SigningAlgorithm`: The name of the algorithm that will be used to sign the certificate to be issued.  This parameter should not be confused with the SigningAlgorithm parameter used to sign a CSR.
- `Validity`: Information describing the validity period of the certificate. When issuing a certificate, ACM Private CA sets the \"Not Before\" date in the validity field to date and time minus 60 minutes. This is intended to compensate for time inconsistencies across systems of 60 minutes or less.  The validity period configured on a certificate must not exceed the limit set by its parents in the CA hierarchy.

# Optional Parameters
- `IdempotencyToken`: Custom string that can be used to distinguish between calls to the IssueCertificate action. Idempotency tokens time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call IssueCertificate multiple times with the same idempotency token within 5 minutes, ACM Private CA recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, PCA recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.
- `TemplateArn`: Specifies a custom configuration template to use when issuing a certificate. If this parameter is not provided, ACM Private CA defaults to the EndEntityCertificate/V1 template. For CA certificates, you should choose the shortest path length that meets your needs. The path length is indicated by the PathLenN portion of the ARN, where N is the CA depth. Note: The CA depth configured on a subordinate CA certificate must not exceed the limit set by its parents in the CA hierarchy. The following service-owned TemplateArn values are supported by ACM Private CA:    arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/CodeSigningCertificate/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/CodeSigningCertificate_CSRPassthrough/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/EndEntityCertificate/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/EndEntityCertificate_CSRPassthrough/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/EndEntityClientAuthCertificate/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/EndEntityClientAuthCertificate_CSRPassthrough/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/EndEntityServerAuthCertificate/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/EndEntityServerAuthCertificate_CSRPassthrough/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/OCSPSigningCertificate/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/OCSPSigningCertificate_CSRPassthrough/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/RootCACertificate/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/SubordinateCACertificate_PathLen0/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/SubordinateCACertificate_PathLen1/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/SubordinateCACertificate_PathLen2/V1   arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/SubordinateCACertificate_PathLen3/V1   For more information, see Using Templates.

    ListPermissions()

List all permissions on a private CA, if any, granted to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).  These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM certificates that reside in the same AWS account as the CA.  Permissions can be granted with the CreatePermission action and revoked with the DeletePermission action.  About Permissions    If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.   For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.   If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA.  

# Required Parameters
- `CertificateAuthorityArn`: The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to inspect. You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action. This must be of the form: arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 You can get a private CA's ARN by running the ListCertificateAuthorities action.

# Optional Parameters
- `MaxResults`: When paginating results, use this parameter to specify the maximum number of items to return in the response. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the NextToken element is sent in the response. Use this NextToken value in a subsequent request to retrieve additional items.

"""
    PutPolicy()

Attaches a resource-based policy to a private CA.  A policy can also be applied by sharing a private CA through AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). The policy can be displayed with GetPolicy and removed with DeletePolicy.  About Policies    A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to AWS Organizations, or to an AWS Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA.   A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.   For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the ACM Private CA policy. For more information, see Using a Service Linked Role with ACM.   Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see Using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) with ACM Private CA.  

# Required Parameters
- `Policy`: The path and filename of a JSON-formatted IAM policy to attach to the specified private CA resource. If this policy does not contain all required statements or if it includes any statement that is not allowed, the PutPolicy action returns an InvalidPolicyException. For information about IAM policy and statement structure, see Overview of JSON Policies.
- `ResourceArn`: The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to associate with the policy. The ARN of the CA can be found by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.

"""
    RestoreCertificateAuthority()

Restores a certificate authority (CA) that is in the DELETED state. You can restore a CA during the period that you defined in the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter of the DeleteCertificateAuthority action. Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not specify a PermanentDeletionTimeInDays value, by default you can restore the CA at any time in a 30 day period. You can check the time remaining in the restoration period of a private CA in the DELETED state by calling the DescribeCertificateAuthority or ListCertificateAuthorities actions. The status of a restored CA is set to its pre-deletion status when the RestoreCertificateAuthority action returns. To change its status to ACTIVE, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action. If the private CA was in the PENDING_CERTIFICATE state at deletion, you must use the ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate action to import a certificate authority into the private CA before it can be activated. You cannot restore a CA after the restoration period has ended.

# Required Parameters
- `CertificateAuthorityArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called the CreateCertificateAuthority action. This must be of the form:   arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

"""
    RevokeCertificate()

Revokes a certificate that was issued inside ACM Private CA. If you enable a certificate revocation list (CRL) when you create or update your private CA, information about the revoked certificates will be included in the CRL. ACM Private CA writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that you specify. A CRL is typically updated approximately 30 minutes after a certificate is revoked. If for any reason the CRL update fails, ACM Private CA attempts makes further attempts every 15 minutes. With Amazon CloudWatch, you can create alarms for the metrics CRLGenerated and MisconfiguredCRLBucket. For more information, see Supported CloudWatch Metrics.  Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see Configure Access to ACM Private CA.  ACM Private CA also writes revocation information to the audit report. For more information, see CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport.  You cannot revoke a root CA self-signed certificate. 

# Required Parameters
- `CertificateAuthorityArn`: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that issued the certificate to be revoked. This must be of the form:  arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012  
- `CertificateSerial`: Serial number of the certificate to be revoked. This must be in hexadecimal format. You can retrieve the serial number by calling GetCertificate with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate you want and the ARN of your private CA. The GetCertificate action retrieves the certificate in the PEM format. You can use the following OpenSSL command to list the certificate in text format and copy the hexadecimal serial number.   openssl x509 -in file_path -text -noout  You can also copy the serial number from the console or use the DescribeCertificate action in the AWS Certificate Manager API Reference. 
- `RevocationReason`: Specifies why you revoked the certificate.
