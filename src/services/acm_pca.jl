    CreateCertificateAuthority()

Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must specify the CA configuration, the certificate revocation list (CRL) configuration, the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA.

Required Parameters
{
  "CertificateAuthorityConfiguration": "Name and bit size of the private key algorithm, the name of the signing algorithm, and X.500 certificate subject information.",
  "CertificateAuthorityType": "The type of the certificate authority."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "IdempotencyToken": "Alphanumeric string that can be used to distinguish between calls to CreateCertificateAuthority. Idempotency tokens time out after five minutes. Therefore, if you call CreateCertificateAuthority multiple times with the same idempotency token within a five minute period, ACM Private CA recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate. As a result, ACM Private CA issues only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, however, ACM Private CA recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.",
  "RevocationConfiguration": "Contains a Boolean value that you can use to enable a certification revocation list (CRL) for the CA, the name of the S3 bucket to which ACM Private CA will write the CRL, and an optional CNAME alias that you can use to hide the name of your bucket in the CRL Distribution Points extension of your CA certificate. For more information, see the CrlConfiguration structure. ",
  "Tags": "Key-value pairs that will be attached to the new private CA. You can associate up to 50 tags with a private CA. For information using tags with  IAM to manage permissions, see Controlling Access Using IAM Tags."

    CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport()

Creates an audit report that lists every time that your CA private key is used. The report is saved in the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify on input. The IssueCertificate and RevokeCertificate actions use the private key.

    CreatePermission()

Assigns permissions from a private CA to a designated AWS service. Services are specified by their service principals and can be given permission to create and retrieve certificates on a private CA. Services can also be given permission to list the active permissions that the private CA has granted. For ACM to automatically renew your private CA's certificates, you must assign all possible permissions from the CA to the ACM service principal. At this time, you can only assign permissions to ACM (acm.amazonaws.com). Permissions can be revoked with the DeletePermission action and listed with the ListPermissions action.

Required Parameters
{
  "Actions": "The actions that the specified AWS service principal can use. These include IssueCertificate, GetCertificate, and ListPermissions.",
  "CertificateAuthorityArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA that grants the permissions. You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.

"""
    DeleteCertificateAuthority()

Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.   Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in your CA hierarchy.  Before you can delete a CA that you have created and activated, you must disable it. To do this, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action and set the CertificateAuthorityStatus parameter to DISABLED.  Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is CREATING). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is PENDING_CERTIFICATE).  When you successfully call DeleteCertificateAuthority, the CA's status changes to DELETED. However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The DescribeCertificateAuthority action returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the DELETED state. To restore an eligible CA, call the RestoreCertificateAuthority action.

Required Parameters
{
  "CertificateAuthorityArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called CreateCertificateAuthority. This must have the following form:   arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 . "
