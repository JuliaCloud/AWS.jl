    AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress()

Adds IP addresses to an inbound or an outbound resolver endpoint. If you want to adding more than one IP address, submit one AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress request for each IP address. To remove an IP address from an endpoint, see DisassociateResolverEndpointIpAddress.

# Required Parameters
- `IpAddress`: Either the IPv4 address that you want to add to a resolver endpoint or a subnet ID. If you specify a subnet ID, Resolver chooses an IP address for you from the available IPs in the specified subnet.
- `ResolverEndpointId`: The ID of the resolver endpoint that you want to associate IP addresses with.

    AssociateResolverRule()

Associates a resolver rule with a VPC. When you associate a rule with a VPC, Resolver forwards all DNS queries for the domain name that is specified in the rule and that originate in the VPC. The queries are forwarded to the IP addresses for the DNS resolvers that are specified in the rule. For more information about rules, see CreateResolverRule. 

# Required Parameters
- `ResolverRuleId`: The ID of the resolver rule that you want to associate with the VPC. To list the existing resolver rules, use ListResolverRules.
- `VPCId`: The ID of the VPC that you want to associate the resolver rule with.

# Optional Parameters
- `Name`: A name for the association that you're creating between a resolver rule and a VPC.

    CreateResolverEndpoint()

Creates a resolver endpoint. There are two types of resolver endpoints, inbound and outbound:   An inbound resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network or another VPC.   An outbound resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network or another VPC.  

# Required Parameters
- `CreatorRequestId`: A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp. 
- `Direction`: Specify the applicable value:    INBOUND: Resolver forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network or another VPC    OUTBOUND: Resolver forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network or another VPC  
- `IpAddresses`: The subnets and IP addresses in your VPC that you want DNS queries to pass through on the way from your VPCs to your network (for outbound endpoints) or on the way from your network to your VPCs (for inbound resolver endpoints). 
- `SecurityGroupIds`: The ID of one or more security groups that you want to use to control access to this VPC. The security group that you specify must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound resolver endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound resolver endpoints).

# Optional Parameters
- `Name`: A friendly name that lets you easily find a configuration in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.
- `Tags`: A list of the tag keys and values that you want to associate with the endpoint.

"""
    CreateResolverRule()

For DNS queries that originate in your VPCs, specifies which resolver endpoint the queries pass through, one domain name that you want to forward to your network, and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers in your network.

# Required Parameters
- `CreatorRequestId`: A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp. 
- `DomainName`: DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded to the IP addresses that you specify in TargetIps. If a query matches multiple resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), outbound DNS queries are routed using the resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).
- `RuleType`: Specify FORWARD. Other resolver rule types aren't supported.

# Optional Parameters
- `Name`: A friendly name that lets you easily find a rule in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.
- `ResolverEndpointId`: The ID of the outbound resolver endpoint that you want to use to route DNS queries to the IP addresses that you specify in TargetIps.
- `Tags`: A list of the tag keys and values that you want to associate with the endpoint.

    DeleteResolverEndpoint()
