    AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress()

Adds IP addresses to an inbound or an outbound Resolver endpoint. If you want to add more than one IP address, submit one AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress request for each IP address. To remove an IP address from an endpoint, see DisassociateResolverEndpointIpAddress. 

# Required Parameters
- `IpAddress`: Either the IPv4 address that you want to add to a Resolver endpoint or a subnet ID. If you specify a subnet ID, Resolver chooses an IP address for you from the available IPs in the specified subnet.
- `ResolverEndpointId`: The ID of the Resolver endpoint that you want to associate IP addresses with.

    AssociateResolverRule()

Associates a Resolver rule with a VPC. When you associate a rule with a VPC, Resolver forwards all DNS queries for the domain name that is specified in the rule and that originate in the VPC. The queries are forwarded to the IP addresses for the DNS resolvers that are specified in the rule. For more information about rules, see CreateResolverRule.

- `ResolverRuleId`: The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to associate with the VPC. To list the existing Resolver rules, use ListResolverRules.

    CreateResolverEndpoint()

Creates a Resolver endpoint. There are two types of Resolver endpoints, inbound and outbound:   An inbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network.   An outbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network.  

# Required Parameters
- `CreatorRequestId`: A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp. 
- `Direction`: Specify the applicable value:    INBOUND: Resolver forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network    OUTBOUND: Resolver forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network  
- `IpAddresses`: The subnets and IP addresses in your VPC that DNS queries originate from (for outbound endpoints) or that you forward DNS queries to (for inbound endpoints). The subnet ID uniquely identifies a VPC. 
- `SecurityGroupIds`: The ID of one or more security groups that you want to use to control access to this VPC. The security group that you specify must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound Resolver endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound Resolver endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access. For inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access, open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

# Optional Parameters
- `Name`: A friendly name that lets you easily find a configuration in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.
- `Tags`: A list of the tag keys and values that you want to associate with the endpoint.

"""
    CreateResolverQueryLogConfig()

Creates a Resolver query logging configuration, which defines where you want Resolver to save DNS query logs that originate in your VPCs. Resolver can log queries only for VPCs that are in the same Region as the query logging configuration. To specify which VPCs you want to log queries for, you use AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig. For more information, see AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig.  You can optionally use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other AWS accounts. The other accounts can then associate VPCs with the configuration. The query logs that Resolver creates for a configuration include all DNS queries that originate in all VPCs that are associated with the configuration.

# Required Parameters
- `CreatorRequestId`: A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp. 
- `DestinationArn`: The ARN of the resource that you want Resolver to send query logs. You can send query logs to an S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Examples of valid values include the following:    S3 bucket:   arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket  You can optionally append a file prefix to the end of the ARN.  arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/development/     CloudWatch Logs log group:   arn:aws:logs:us-west-1:123456789012:log-group:/mystack-testgroup-12ABC1AB12A1:*     Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream:  arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-2:0123456789:stream/my_stream_name

    CreateResolverRule()

For DNS queries that originate in your VPCs, specifies which Resolver endpoint the queries pass through, one domain name that you want to forward to your network, and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers in your network.

# Required Parameters
- `CreatorRequestId`: A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp. 
- `DomainName`: DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded to the IP addresses that you specify in TargetIps. If a query matches multiple Resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), outbound DNS queries are routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).
- `RuleType`: When you want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD. When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a domain to your network and you want Resolver to process queries for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM. For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for RuleType. To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType. Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of RECURSIVE for RuleType.

# Optional Parameters
- `Name`: A friendly name that lets you easily find a rule in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.
- `ResolverEndpointId`: The ID of the outbound Resolver endpoint that you want to use to route DNS queries to the IP addresses that you specify in TargetIps.
- `Tags`: A list of the tag keys and values that you want to associate with the endpoint.
- `TargetIps`: The IPs that you want Resolver to forward DNS queries to. You can specify only IPv4 addresses. Separate IP addresses with a comma.  TargetIps is available only when the value of Rule type is FORWARD.

Valid values include the following elements:    Arn: The ARN of the query logging configuration    AssociationCount: The number of VPCs that are associated with the specified configuration     CreationTime: The date and time that Resolver returned when the configuration was created    CreatorRequestId: The value that was specified for CreatorRequestId when the configuration was created    DestinationArn: The location that logs are sent to    Id: The ID of the configuration    Name: The name of the configuration    OwnerId: The AWS account number of the account that created the configuration    ShareStatus: Whether the configuration is shared with other AWS accounts or shared with the current account by another AWS account. Sharing is configured through AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM).    Status: The current status of the configuration. Valid values include the following:    CREATING: Resolver is creating the query logging configuration.    CREATED: The query logging configuration was successfully created. Resolver is logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.    DELETING: Resolver is deleting this query logging configuration.    FAILED: Resolver either couldn't create or couldn't delete the query logging configuration. Here are two common causes:   The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.   Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.      
- `SortOrder`: If you specified a value for SortBy, the order that you want query logging configurations to be listed in, ASCENDING or DESCENDING.  If you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfigs request and specify the NextToken parameter, you must use the same value for SortOrder, if any, as in the previous request.
