    CancelJob()

The CancelJob operation cancels an unfinished job.  You can only cancel a job that has a status of Submitted. To prevent a pipeline from starting to process a job while you're getting the job identifier, use UpdatePipelineStatus to temporarily pause the pipeline. 

# Required Parameters
- `Id`: The identifier of the job that you want to cancel. To get a list of the jobs (including their jobId) that have a status of Submitted, use the ListJobsByStatus API action.

"""
    CreateJob()

When you create a job, Elastic Transcoder returns JSON data that includes the values that you specified plus information about the job that is created. If you have specified more than one output for your jobs (for example, one output for the Kindle Fire and another output for the Apple iPhone 4s), you currently must use the Elastic Transcoder API to list the jobs (as opposed to the AWS Console).

# Required Parameters
- `PipelineId`: The Id of the pipeline that you want Elastic Transcoder to use for transcoding. The pipeline determines several settings, including the Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic Transcoder gets the files to transcode and the bucket into which Elastic Transcoder puts the transcoded files.

# Optional Parameters
- `Input`: A section of the request body that provides information about the file that is being transcoded.
- `Inputs`: A section of the request body that provides information about the files that are being transcoded.
- `Output`:  A section of the request body that provides information about the transcoded (target) file. We strongly recommend that you use the Outputs syntax instead of the Output syntax. 
- `OutputKeyPrefix`: The value, if any, that you want Elastic Transcoder to prepend to the names of all files that this job creates, including output files, thumbnails, and playlists.
- `Outputs`:  A section of the request body that provides information about the transcoded (target) files. We recommend that you use the Outputs syntax instead of the Output syntax. 
- `Playlists`: If you specify a preset in PresetId for which the value of Container is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), Playlists contains information about the master playlists that you want Elastic Transcoder to create. The maximum number of master playlists in a job is 30.
- `UserMetadata`: User-defined metadata that you want to associate with an Elastic Transcoder job. You specify metadata in key/value pairs, and you can add up to 10 key/value pairs per job. Elastic Transcoder does not guarantee that key/value pairs are returned in the same order in which you specify them.

    CreatePreset()

The CreatePreset operation creates a preset with settings that you specify.  Elastic Transcoder checks the CreatePreset settings to ensure that they meet Elastic Transcoder requirements and to determine whether they comply with H.264 standards. If your settings are not valid for Elastic Transcoder, Elastic Transcoder returns an HTTP 400 response (ValidationException) and does not create the preset. If the settings are valid for Elastic Transcoder but aren't strictly compliant with the H.264 standard, Elastic Transcoder creates the preset and returns a warning message in the response. This helps you determine whether your settings comply with the H.264 standard while giving you greater flexibility with respect to the video that Elastic Transcoder produces.  Elastic Transcoder uses the H.264 video-compression format. For more information, see the International Telecommunication Union publication Recommendation ITU-T H.264: Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services.

    UpdatePipelineNotifications()

With the UpdatePipelineNotifications operation, you can update Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications for a pipeline. When you update notifications for a pipeline, Elastic Transcoder returns the values that you specified in the request.

# Required Parameters
- `Id`: The identifier of the pipeline for which you want to change notification settings.
- `Notifications`: The topic ARN for the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you want to notify to report job status.  To receive notifications, you must also subscribe to the new topic in the Amazon SNS console.     Progressing: The topic ARN for the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder has started to process jobs that are added to this pipeline. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.    Complete: The topic ARN for the Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder has finished processing a job. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.    Warning: The topic ARN for the Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder encounters a warning condition. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.    Error: The topic ARN for the Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder encounters an error condition. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.

    UpdatePipelineStatus()

The UpdatePipelineStatus operation pauses or reactivates a pipeline, so that the pipeline stops or restarts the processing of jobs. Changing the pipeline status is useful if you want to cancel one or more jobs. You can't cancel jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started processing them; if you pause the pipeline to which you submitted the jobs, you have more time to get the job IDs for the jobs that you want to cancel, and to send a CancelJob request. 

# Required Parameters
- `Id`: The identifier of the pipeline to update.
- `Status`: The desired status of the pipeline:    Active: The pipeline is processing jobs.    Paused: The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.
