    cancel_job(id)
    cancel_job(id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The CancelJob operation cancels an unfinished job.  You can only cancel a job that has a
status of Submitted. To prevent a pipeline from starting to process a job while you're
getting the job identifier, use UpdatePipelineStatus to temporarily pause the pipeline.

# Arguments
- `id`: The identifier of the job that you want to cancel. To get a list of the jobs
  (including their jobId) that have a status of Submitted, use the ListJobsByStatus API
  action.

    create_job(pipeline_id)
    create_job(pipeline_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

When you create a job, Elastic Transcoder returns JSON data that includes the values that
you specified plus information about the job that is created. If you have specified more
than one output for your jobs (for example, one output for the Kindle Fire and another
output for the Apple iPhone 4s), you currently must use the Elastic Transcoder API to list
the jobs (as opposed to the AWS Console).

# Arguments
- `pipeline_id`: The Id of the pipeline that you want Elastic Transcoder to use for
  transcoding. The pipeline determines several settings, including the Amazon S3 bucket from
  which Elastic Transcoder gets the files to transcode and the bucket into which Elastic
  Transcoder puts the transcoded files.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Input"`: A section of the request body that provides information about the file that is
  being transcoded.
- `"Inputs"`: A section of the request body that provides information about the files that
  are being transcoded.
- `"Output"`:  A section of the request body that provides information about the transcoded
  (target) file. We strongly recommend that you use the Outputs syntax instead of the Output
  syntax.
- `"OutputKeyPrefix"`: The value, if any, that you want Elastic Transcoder to prepend to
  the names of all files that this job creates, including output files, thumbnails, and
  playlists.
- `"Outputs"`:  A section of the request body that provides information about the
  transcoded (target) files. We recommend that you use the Outputs syntax instead of the
  Output syntax.
- `"Playlists"`: If you specify a preset in PresetId for which the value of Container is
  fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), Playlists contains information about the master
  playlists that you want Elastic Transcoder to create. The maximum number of master
  playlists in a job is 30.
- `"UserMetadata"`: User-defined metadata that you want to associate with an Elastic
  Transcoder job. You specify metadata in key/value pairs, and you can add up to 10 key/value
  pairs per job. Elastic Transcoder does not guarantee that key/value pairs are returned in
  the same order in which you specify them.

  object:     Canonical: The value in the Grantee object is either the canonical user ID for
  an AWS account or an origin access identity for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. For more
  information about canonical user IDs, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon
  Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. For more information about using CloudFront origin
  access identities to require that users use CloudFront URLs instead of Amazon S3 URLs, see
  Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content.  A canonical
  user ID is not the same as an AWS account number.     Email: The value in the Grantee
  object is the registered email address of an AWS account.    Group: The value in the
  Grantee object is one of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups: AllUsers,
  AuthenticatedUsers, or LogDelivery.      Grantee: The AWS user or group that you want to
  have access to transcoded files and playlists. To identify the user or group, you can
  specify the canonical user ID for an AWS account, an origin access identity for a
  CloudFront distribution, the registered email address of an AWS account, or a predefined

  Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.      StorageClass: The Amazon S3 storage class,
  Standard or ReducedRedundancy, that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video
  files and playlists that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.
- `"Notifications"`: The Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you
  want to notify to report job status.  To receive notifications, you must also subscribe to
  the new topic in the Amazon SNS console.     Progressing: The topic ARN for the Amazon
  Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you want to notify when Elastic
  Transcoder has started to process a job in this pipeline. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS
  returned when you created the topic. For more information, see Create a Topic in the Amazon
  Simple Notification Service Developer Guide.    Complete: The topic ARN for the Amazon SNS
  topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder has finished processing a job in this
  pipeline. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.    Warning:
  The topic ARN for the Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder
  encounters a warning condition while processing a job in this pipeline. This is the ARN
  that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.    Error: The topic ARN for the Amazon
  SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder encounters an error condition
  while processing a job in this pipeline. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you
  created the topic.
- `"OutputBucket"`: The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save the
  transcoded files. (Use this, or use ContentConfig:Bucket plus ThumbnailConfig:Bucket.)
  Specify this value when all of the following are true:   You want to save transcoded files,
  thumbnails (if any), and playlists (if any) together in one bucket.   You do not want to
  specify the users or groups who have access to the transcoded files, thumbnails, and
  playlists.   You do not want to specify the permissions that Elastic Transcoder grants to
  the files.   When Elastic Transcoder saves files in OutputBucket, it grants full control
  over the files only to the AWS account that owns the role that is specified by Role.    You
  want to associate the transcoded files and thumbnails with the Amazon S3 Standard storage
  class.   If you want to save transcoded files and playlists in one bucket and thumbnails in
  another bucket, specify which users can access the transcoded files or the permissions the
  users have, or change the Amazon S3 storage class, omit OutputBucket and specify values for
  ContentConfig and ThumbnailConfig instead.
- `"ThumbnailConfig"`: The ThumbnailConfig object specifies several values, including the
  Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save thumbnail files, which users
  you want to have access to the files, the type of access you want users to have, and the
  storage class that you want to assign to the files. If you specify values for
  ContentConfig, you must also specify values for ThumbnailConfig even if you don't want to
  create thumbnails. If you specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailConfig, omit the
  OutputBucket object.    Bucket: The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder
  to save thumbnail files.    Permissions (Optional): The Permissions object specifies which

    create_preset(container, name)
    create_preset(container, name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The CreatePreset operation creates a preset with settings that you specify.  Elastic
Transcoder checks the CreatePreset settings to ensure that they meet Elastic Transcoder
requirements and to determine whether they comply with H.264 standards. If your settings
are not valid for Elastic Transcoder, Elastic Transcoder returns an HTTP 400 response
(ValidationException) and does not create the preset. If the settings are valid for Elastic
Transcoder but aren't strictly compliant with the H.264 standard, Elastic Transcoder
creates the preset and returns a warning message in the response. This helps you determine
whether your settings comply with the H.264 standard while giving you greater flexibility
with respect to the video that Elastic Transcoder produces.  Elastic Transcoder uses the
H.264 video-compression format. For more information, see the International
Telecommunication Union publication Recommendation ITU-T H.264: Advanced video coding for
generic audiovisual services.

  account, but uniqueness is not enforced. Constraints: Maximum 40 characters
- `"Notifications"`: The topic ARN for the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)
  topic that you want to notify to report job status.  To receive notifications, you must
  also subscribe to the new topic in the Amazon SNS console.     Progressing: The topic ARN
  for the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you want to notify when
  Elastic Transcoder has started to process jobs that are added to this pipeline. This is the
  ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.    Complete: The topic ARN for the
  Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder has finished processing a
  job. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.    Warning: The
  topic ARN for the Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder
  encounters a warning condition. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created
  the topic.    Error: The topic ARN for the Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when
  Elastic Transcoder encounters an error condition. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned
  when you created the topic.
- `"Role"`: The IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the role that you want Elastic
  Transcoder to use to transcode jobs for this pipeline.
- `"ThumbnailConfig"`: The ThumbnailConfig object specifies several values, including the
  Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save thumbnail files, which users
  you want to have access to the files, the type of access you want users to have, and the
  storage class that you want to assign to the files. If you specify values for
  ContentConfig, you must also specify values for ThumbnailConfig even if you don't want to
  create thumbnails. If you specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailConfig, omit the
  OutputBucket object.    Bucket: The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder
  to save thumbnail files.    Permissions (Optional): The Permissions object specifies which
  users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups you want to have access to thumbnail files, and
  the type of access you want them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum of 30
  users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.    GranteeType: Specify the type of value that
  appears in the Grantee object:    Canonical: The value in the Grantee object is either the
  canonical user ID for an AWS account or an origin access identity for an Amazon CloudFront
  distribution.  A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS account number.     Email: The
  value in the Grantee object is the registered email address of an AWS account.    Group:
  The value in the Grantee object is one of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups:
  AllUsers, AuthenticatedUsers, or LogDelivery.      Grantee: The AWS user or group that you
  want to have access to thumbnail files. To identify the user or group, you can specify the
  canonical user ID for an AWS account, an origin access identity for a CloudFront
  distribution, the registered email address of an AWS account, or a predefined Amazon S3
  group.     Access: The permission that you want to give to the AWS user that you specified
  in Grantee. Permissions are granted on the thumbnail files that Elastic Transcoder adds to
  the bucket. Valid values include:     READ: The grantee can read the thumbnails and
  metadata for objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.    READ_ACP: The
  grantee can read the object ACL for thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon
  S3 bucket.    WRITE_ACP: The grantee can write the ACL for the thumbnails that Elastic
  Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.    FULL_CONTROL: The grantee has READ, READ_ACP,
  and WRITE_ACP permissions for the thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3
  bucket.       StorageClass: The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy,
  that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the thumbnails that it stores in your Amazon
  S3 bucket.

With the UpdatePipelineNotifications operation, you can update Amazon Simple Notification
Service (Amazon SNS) notifications for a pipeline. When you update notifications for a
pipeline, Elastic Transcoder returns the values that you specified in the request.

# Arguments
- `id`: The identifier of the pipeline for which you want to change notification settings.
- `notifications`: The topic ARN for the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)
  topic that you want to notify to report job status.  To receive notifications, you must
  also subscribe to the new topic in the Amazon SNS console.     Progressing: The topic ARN
  for the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you want to notify when
  Elastic Transcoder has started to process jobs that are added to this pipeline. This is the

    update_pipeline_status(id, status, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

The UpdatePipelineStatus operation pauses or reactivates a pipeline, so that the pipeline
stops or restarts the processing of jobs. Changing the pipeline status is useful if you
want to cancel one or more jobs. You can't cancel jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started
processing them; if you pause the pipeline to which you submitted the jobs, you have more
time to get the job IDs for the jobs that you want to cancel, and to send a CancelJob
request.

# Arguments
- `id`: The identifier of the pipeline to update.
- `status`: The desired status of the pipeline:    Active: The pipeline is processing jobs.
     Paused: The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.
