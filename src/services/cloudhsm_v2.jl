# Arguments
- `backup_id`: The ID of the backup that will be copied to the destination region.

Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"TagList"`: Tags to apply to the destination backup during creation. If you specify
  tags, only these tags will be applied to the destination backup. If you do not specify

Creates a new CloudHSM cluster.  Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with an
CloudHSM backup in a different AWS account, specify the full backup ARN in the value of the
SourceBackupId parameter.

# Arguments
- `hsm_type`: The type of HSM to use in the cluster. The allowed values are hsm1.medium and
  hsm2m.medium.
- `subnet_ids`: The identifiers (IDs) of the subnets where you are creating the cluster.
  You must specify at least one subnet. If you specify multiple subnets, they must meet the
  following criteria:   All subnets must be in the same virtual private cloud (VPC).   You
  can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"BackupRetentionPolicy"`: A policy that defines how the service retains backups.
- `"Mode"`: The mode to use in the cluster. The allowed values are FIPS and NON_FIPS.
- `"SourceBackupId"`: The identifier (ID) or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
  backup to restore. Use this value to restore the cluster from a backup instead of creating
  a new cluster. To find the backup ID or ARN, use DescribeBackups. If using a backup in
  another account, the full ARN must be supplied.
- `"TagList"`: Tags to apply to the CloudHSM cluster during creation.

    describe_backups()
    describe_backups(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Gets information about backups of CloudHSM clusters. Lists either the backups you own or
the backups shared with you when the Shared parameter is true. This is a paginated
operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the backups.
When the response contains only a subset of backups, it includes a NextToken value. Use
this value in a subsequent DescribeBackups request to get more backups. When you receive a
response with no NextToken (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more
backups to get.  Cross-account use: Yes. Customers can describe backups in other Amazon Web
Services accounts that are shared with them.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Filters"`: One or more filters to limit the items returned in the response. Use the
  backupIds filter to return only the specified backups. Specify backups by their backup
  identifier (ID). Use the sourceBackupIds filter to return only the backups created from a
  source backup. The sourceBackupID of a source backup is returned by the CopyBackupToRegion
  operation. Use the clusterIds filter to return only the backups for the specified clusters.
  Specify clusters by their cluster identifier (ID). Use the states filter to return only
  backups that match the specified state. Use the neverExpires filter to return backups
  filtered by the value in the neverExpires parameter. True returns all backups exempt from
  the backup retention policy. False returns all backups with a backup retention policy
  defined at the cluster.
- `"MaxResults"`: The maximum number of backups to return in the response. When there are
  more backups than the number you specify, the response contains a NextToken value.
- `"NextToken"`: The NextToken value that you received in the previous response. Use this
  value to get more backups.
- `"Shared"`: Describe backups that are shared with you.  By default when using this
  option, the command returns backups that have been shared using a standard Resource Access
  Manager resource share. In order for a backup that was shared using the PutResourcePolicy
  command to be returned, the share must be promoted to a standard resource share using the
  RAM PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy API operation. For more information about sharing
  backups, see  Working with shared backups in the CloudHSM User Guide.
- `"SortAscending"`: Designates whether or not to sort the return backups by ascending
  chronological order of generation.

Creates or updates an CloudHSM resource policy. A resource policy helps you to define the
IAM entity (for example, an Amazon Web Services account) that can manage your CloudHSM
resources. The following resources support CloudHSM resource policies:     Backup - The
resource policy allows you to describe the backup and restore a cluster from the backup in
another Amazon Web Services account.   In order to share a backup, it must be in a 'READY'
state and you must own it.  While you can share a backup using the CloudHSM
PutResourcePolicy operation, we recommend using Resource Access Manager (RAM) instead.
Using RAM provides multiple benefits as it creates the policy for you, allows multiple
resources to be shared at one time, and increases the discoverability of shared resources.
If you use PutResourcePolicy and want consumers to be able to describe the backups you
share with them, you must promote the backup to a standard RAM Resource Share using the RAM
PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy API operation. For more information, see  Working
with shared backups in the CloudHSM User Guide   Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform
this operation on an CloudHSM resource in a different Amazon Web Services account.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Policy"`: The policy you want to associate with a resource.  For an example policy, see
   Working with shared backups in the CloudHSM User Guide
- `"ResourceArn"`: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to which you want to attach a
  policy.
