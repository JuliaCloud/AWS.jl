    DetectEntities()

The DetectEntities operation is deprecated. You should use the DetectEntitiesV2 operation instead.  Inspects the clinical text for a variety of medical entities and returns specific information about them such as entity category, location, and confidence score on that information .

    DetectEntitiesV2()

Inspects the clinical text for a variety of medical entities and returns specific information about them such as entity category, location, and confidence score on that information. Amazon Comprehend Medical only detects medical entities in English language texts. The DetectEntitiesV2 operation replaces the DetectEntities operation. This new action uses a different model for determining the entities in your medical text and changes the way that some entities are returned in the output. You should use the DetectEntitiesV2 operation in all new applications. The DetectEntitiesV2 operation returns the Acuity and Direction entities as attributes instead of types.
