    cancel_task_execution(task_execution_arn)
    cancel_task_execution(task_execution_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Cancels execution of a task.  When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files
is abruptly interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination
might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task
execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on
the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that
interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, AWS DataSync successfully complete the
transfer when you start the next task execution.

# Arguments
- `task_execution_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution to cancel.

    create_agent(activation_key)
    create_agent(activation_key, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process
associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information
such as the AWS Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in
the AWS Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks
are created in this AWS Region. You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud)
or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the
public internet. You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple
agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple
agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task
to run.  Agents are automatically updated by AWS on a regular basis, using a mechanism that
ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.

# Arguments
- `activation_key`: Your agent activation key. You can get the activation key either by
  sending an HTTP GET request with redirects that enable you to get the agent IP address
  (port 80). Alternatively, you can get it from the AWS DataSync console. The redirect URL
  returned in the response provides you the activation key for your agent in the query string
  parameter activationKey. It might also include other activation-related parameters;
  however, these are merely defaults. The arguments you pass to this API call determine the
  actual configuration of your agent. For more information, see Activating an Agent in the
  AWS DataSync User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AgentName"`: The name you configured for your agent. This value is a text reference
  that is used to identify the agent in the console.
- `"SecurityGroupArns"`: The ARNs of the security groups used to protect your data transfer
  task subnets. See CreateAgentRequestSubnetArns.
- `"SubnetArns"`: The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets in which DataSync will
  create elastic network interfaces for each data transfer task. The agent that runs a task
  must be private. When you start a task that is associated with an agent created in a VPC,
  or one that has access to an IP address in a VPC, then the task is also private. In this
  case, DataSync creates four network interfaces for each task in your subnet. For a data
  transfer to work, the agent must be able to route to all these four network interfaces.
- `"Tags"`: The key-value pair that represents the tag that you want to associate with the
  agent. The value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search
  for your agents.  Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers
  representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.
- `"VpcEndpointId"`: The ID of the VPC (virtual private cloud) endpoint that the agent has
  access to. This is the client-side VPC endpoint, also called a PrivateLink. If you don't
  have a PrivateLink VPC endpoint, see Creating a VPC Endpoint Service Configuration in the
  Amazon VPC User Guide. VPC endpoint ID looks like this: vpce-01234d5aff67890e1.

    create_location_efs(ec2_config, efs_filesystem_arn)
    create_location_efs(ec2_config, efs_filesystem_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an endpoint for an Amazon EFS file system.

# Arguments
- `ec2_config`: The subnet and security group that the Amazon EFS file system uses. The
  security group that you provide needs to be able to communicate with the security group on
  the mount target in the subnet specified. The exact relationship between security group M
  (of the mount target) and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use at this
  stage) is as follows:     Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must
  allow inbound access for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on the NFS port (2049)
  from security group S. You can enable inbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range)
  or security group.    Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have a
  rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of the file system’s mount
  targets. You can enable outbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security
  group. For information about security groups and mount targets, see Security Groups for
  Amazon EC2 Instances and Mount Targets in the Amazon EFS User Guide.
- `efs_filesystem_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon EFS file system.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Subdirectory"`: A subdirectory in the location’s path. This subdirectory in the EFS
  file system is used to read data from the EFS source location or write data to the EFS
  destination. By default, AWS DataSync uses the root directory.   Subdirectory must be
  specified with forward slashes. For example, /path/to/folder.
- `"Tags"`: The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the resource.
  The value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search for your
  resources. We recommend that you create a name tag for your location.

    create_location_nfs(on_prem_config, server_hostname, subdirectory, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Defines a file system on a Network File System (NFS) server that can be read from or
written to.

# Arguments
- `on_prem_config`: Contains a list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents that are used
  to connect to an NFS server.  If you are copying data to or from your AWS Snowcone device,
  see NFS Server on AWS Snowcone for more information.
- `server_hostname`: The name of the NFS server. This value is the IP address or Domain
  Name Service (DNS) name of the NFS server. An agent that is installed on-premises uses this
  host name to mount the NFS server in a network.  If you are copying data to or from your
  AWS Snowcone device, see NFS Server on AWS Snowcone for more information.  This name must
  either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP version 4 (IPv4) address.
- `subdirectory`: The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used to read data from
  the NFS source location or write data to the NFS destination. The NFS path should be a path
  that's exported by the NFS server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such
  that it can be mounted by other NFS clients in your network.  To see all the paths exported
  by your NFS server, run \"showmount -e nfs-server-name\" from an NFS client that has access
  to your server. You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any
  subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is accessible without Kerberos
  authentication.  To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to
  have permissions to read all the data. To ensure this, either configure the NFS export with
  no_root_squash, or ensure that the permissions for all of the files that you want DataSync
  allow read access for all users. Doing either enables the agent to read the files. For the
  agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access. If you are
  copying data to or from your AWS Snowcone device, see NFS Server on AWS Snowcone for more
  information. For information about NFS export configuration, see 18.7. The /etc/exports
  Configuration File in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

    create_task(destination_location_arn, source_location_arn)
    create_task(destination_location_arn, source_location_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a task. A task includes a source location and a destination location, and a
configuration that specifies how data is transferred. A task always transfers data from the
source location to the destination location. The configuration specifies options such as
task scheduling, bandwidth limits, etc. A task is the complete definition of a data
transfer. When you create a task that transfers data between AWS services in different AWS
Regions, one of the two locations that you specify must reside in the Region where DataSync
is being used. The other location must be specified in a different Region. You can transfer
data between commercial AWS Regions except for China, or between AWS GovCloud (US-East and
US-West) Regions.  When you use DataSync to copy files or objects between AWS Regions, you
pay for data transfer between Regions. This is billed as data transfer OUT from your source
Region to your destination Region. For more information, see Data Transfer pricing.

# Arguments
- `destination_location_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS storage resource's
  location.
- `source_location_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source location for the task.

  The list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude.
  The patterns are delimited by \"|\" (that is, a pipe), for example, \"/folder1|/folder2\".
  
- `"Name"`: The name of a task. This value is a text reference that is used to identify the
  task in the console.
- `"Options"`: The set of configuration options that control the behavior of a single
  execution of the task that occurs when you call StartTaskExecution. You can configure these
  options to preserve metadata such as user ID (UID) and group ID (GID), file permissions,
  data integrity verification, and so on. For each individual task execution, you can
  override these options by specifying the OverrideOptions before starting the task
  execution. For more information, see the operation.
- `"Schedule"`: Specifies a schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a
  destination location. The schedule should be specified in UTC time. For more information,
