    DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments()

Provides a list of individual assessments that you can specify for a new premigration assessment run, given one or more parameters. If you specify an existing migration task, this operation provides the default individual assessments you can specify for that task. Otherwise, the specified parameters model elements of a possible migration task on which to base a premigration assessment run. To use these migration task modeling parameters, you must specify an existing replication instance, a source database engine, a target database engine, and a migration type. This combination of parameters potentially limits the default individual assessments available for an assessment run created for a corresponding migration task. If you specify no parameters, this operation provides a list of all possible individual assessments that you can specify for an assessment run. If you specify any one of the task modeling parameters, you must specify all of them or the operation cannot provide a list of individual assessments. The only parameter that you can specify alone is for an existing migration task. The specified task definition then determines the default list of individual assessments that you can specify in an assessment run for the task.

# Optional Parameters
- `Marker`: Optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords.
- `MaxRecords`: Maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.
- `MigrationType`: Name of the migration type that each provided individual assessment must support.
- `ReplicationInstanceArn`: ARN of a replication instance on which you want to base the default list of individual assessments.
- `ReplicationTaskArn`: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a migration task on which you want to base the default list of individual assessments.
- `SourceEngineName`: Name of a database engine that the specified replication instance supports as a source.

# Optional Parameters
- `AllocatedStorage`: The amount of storage (in gigabytes) to be allocated for the replication instance.
- `AllowMajorVersionUpgrade`: Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

- `ApplyImmediately`: Indicates whether the changes should be applied immediately or during the next maintenance window.
- `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade`: A value that indicates that minor version upgrades are applied automatically to the replication instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, except in the case dsecribed following. The change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.  An outage does result if these factors apply:    This parameter is set to true during the maintenance window.   A newer minor version is available.    AWS DMS has enabled automatic patching for the given engine version.   
- `EngineVersion`: The engine version number of the replication instance. When modifying a major engine version of an instance, also set AllowMajorVersionUpgrade to true.

- `PreferredMaintenanceWindow`: The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If moving this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.
