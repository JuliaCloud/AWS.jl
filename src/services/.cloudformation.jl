    CancelUpdateStack()

Cancels an update on the specified stack. If the call completes successfully, the stack rolls back the update and reverts to the previous stack configuration.  You can cancel only stacks that are in the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state. 

Required Parameters
StackName => The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack.

Optional Parameters
ClientRequestToken => A unique identifier for this CancelUpdateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to cancel an update on a stack with the same name. You might retry CancelUpdateStack requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

"""
    ContinueUpdateRollback()

For a specified stack that is in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state, continues rolling it back to the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually  fix the error and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state), and then try to update the stack again. A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when AWS CloudFormation cannot roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that is rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of AWS CloudFormation. Because AWS CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.

Required Parameters
StackName => The name or the unique ID of the stack that you want to continue rolling back.  Don't specify the name of a nested stack (a stack that was created by using the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource). Instead, use this operation on the parent stack (the stack that contains the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource). 

Optional Parameters
ClientRequestToken => A unique identifier for this ContinueUpdateRollback request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to continue the rollback to a stack with the same name. You might retry ContinueUpdateRollback requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.
ResourcesToSkip => A list of the logical IDs of the resources that AWS CloudFormation skips during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state for other reasons, for example, because an update was cancelled. To check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.   Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that AWS CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources before skipping them. AWS CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to UPDATE_COMPLETE and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.   Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.  To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_COMPLETE, or DELETE_FAILED.   Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update rollback operation with nested stacks, see Using ResourcesToSkip to recover a nested stacks hierarchy.  
RoleARN => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to roll back the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

"""
    CreateChangeSet()

Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that AWS CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, AWS CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources AWS CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack. To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the ChangeSetType parameter, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE for the ChangeSetType parameter. To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT for the ChangeSetType parameter. After the CreateChangeSet call successfully completes, AWS CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the DescribeChangeSet action. When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the ExecuteChangeSet action. AWS CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute the change set.

Required Parameters
ChangeSetName => The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change sets that are associated with the specified stack. A change set name can contain only alphanumeric, case sensitive characters and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot exceed 128 characters.
StackName => The name or the unique ID of the stack for which you are creating a change set. AWS CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this stack's information with the information that you submit, such as a modified template or different parameter input values.

Optional Parameters
Capabilities => In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group      AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User      AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.  This capacity does not apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change sets has no effect. Also, change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template using the CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and specifying this capability.  For more information on macros, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.  
ChangeSetType => The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new stack, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE. To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT. If you create a change set for a new stack, AWS Cloudformation creates a stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or resources. The stack will be in the  REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS  state until you execute the change set. By default, AWS CloudFormation specifies UPDATE. You can't use the UPDATE type to create a change set for a new stack or the CREATE type to create a change set for an existing stack.
ClientToken => A unique identifier for this CreateChangeSet request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create another change set with the same name. You might retry CreateChangeSet requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.
Description => A description to help you identify this change set.
NotificationARNs => The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. To remove all associated notification topics, specify an empty list.
Parameters => A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the change set. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
ResourceTypes => The template resource types that you have permissions to work with if you execute this change set, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or Custom::MyCustomInstance. If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource type that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for condition keys in IAM policies for AWS CloudFormation. For more information, see Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
ResourcesToImport => The resources to import into your stack.
RoleARN => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes when executing the change set. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.
RollbackConfiguration => The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
Tags => Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags.
TemplateBody => A structure that contains the body of the revised template, with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. AWS CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this template with the template of the stack that you specified. Conditional: You must specify only TemplateBody or TemplateURL.
TemplateURL => The location of the file that contains the revised template. The URL must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an S3 bucket. AWS CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this template with the stack that you specified. Conditional: You must specify only TemplateBody or TemplateURL.
UsePreviousTemplate => Whether to reuse the template that is associated with the stack to create the change set.

"""
    CreateStack()

Creates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the stack creation starts. You can check the status of the stack via the DescribeStacks API.

Required Parameters
StackName => The name that is associated with the stack. The name must be unique in the Region in which you are creating the stack.  A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot be longer than 128 characters. 

Optional Parameters
Capabilities => In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users.

If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group      AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User      AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.  
ClientRequestToken => A unique identifier for this CreateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry CreateStack requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002. 
DisableRollback => Set to true to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation failed. You can specify either DisableRollback or OnFailure, but not both. Default: false 
EnableTerminationProtection => Whether to enable termination protection on the specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Termination protection is disabled on stacks by default.   For nested stacks, termination protection is set on the root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.
NotificationARNs => The Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic ARNs to publish stack related events. You can find your SNS topic ARNs using the SNS console or your Command Line Interface (CLI).
OnFailure => Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify either OnFailure or DisableRollback, but not both. Default: ROLLBACK 
Parameters => A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
ResourceTypes => The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this create stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or Custom::MyCustomInstance. Use the following syntax to describe template resource types: AWS::* (for all AWS resource), Custom::* (for all custom resources), Custom::logical_ID  (for a specific custom resource), AWS::service_name::* (for all resources of a particular AWS service), and AWS::service_name::resource_logical_ID  (for a specific AWS resource). If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management.
RoleARN => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.
RollbackConfiguration => The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
StackPolicyBody => Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go to  Prevent Updates to Stack Resources in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.
StackPolicyURL => Location of a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.
Tags => Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified.
TemplateBody => Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both.
TemplateURL => Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, go to the Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both.
TimeoutInMinutes => The amount of time that can pass before the stack status becomes CREATE_FAILED; if DisableRollback is not set or is set to false, the stack will be rolled back.

    CreateStackInstances()

Creates stack instances for the specified accounts, within the specified Regions. A stack instance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region. You must specify at least one value for either Accounts or DeploymentTargets, and you must specify at least one value for Regions.

Required Parameters
Regions => The names of one or more Regions where you want to create stack instances using the specified AWS account(s). 
StackSetName => The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to create stack instances from.

Optional Parameters
Accounts => [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more AWS accounts that you want to create stack instances in the specified Region(s) for. You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not both.
DeploymentTargets => [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts for which to create stack instances in the specified Regions. You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not both.
OperationId => The unique identifier for this stack set operation.  The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.  Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is OUTDATED. 
OperationPreferences => Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.
ParameterOverrides => A list of stack set parameters whose values you want to override in the selected stack instances. Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance operations:   To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value.   To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of the following:   Do not include the parameter in the list.   Include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You cannot specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)     To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters.   To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not specify this property at all.   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template.

    CreateStackSet()

Creates a stack set.

Required Parameters
StackSetName => The name to associate with the stack set. The name must be unique in the Region where you create your stack set.  A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case-sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and can't be longer than 128 characters. 

Optional Parameters
AdministrationRoleARN => The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role to use to create this stack set.  Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same administrator account. For more information, see Prerequisites: Granting Permissions for Stack Set Operations in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
AutoDeployment => Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to AWS Organizations accounts that are added to the target organization or organizational unit (OU). Specify only if PermissionModel is SERVICE_MANAGED.
Capabilities => In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack set and related stack instances.

If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.  Stack sets do not currently support macros in stack templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability, if you include a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.   
ClientRequestToken => A unique identifier for this CreateStackSet request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create another stack set with the same name. You might retry CreateStackSet requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically. 
Description => A description of the stack set. You can use the description to identify the stack set's purpose or other important information.
ExecutionRoleName => The name of the IAM execution role to use to create the stack set. If you do not specify an execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses the AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their stack sets. 
Parameters => The input parameters for the stack set template. 
PermissionModel => Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are created. By default, SELF-MANAGED is specified.   With self-managed permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions.   With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by AWS Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed Stack Set Permissions.  
Tags => The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created from it. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created in the stacks. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified. If you specify tags as part of a CreateStackSet action, AWS CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you don't, the entire CreateStackSet action fails with an access denied error, and the stack set is not created.
TemplateBody => The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, see Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both.

Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their expected template configurations. For more information, see Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources. Use DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all supported resources for a given stack, or DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual resources.

    RegisterType()

Registers a type with the CloudFormation service. Registering a type makes it available for use in CloudFormation templates in your AWS account, and includes:   Validating the resource schema   Determining which handlers have been specified for the resource   Making the resource type available for use in your account   For more information on how to develop types and ready them for registeration, see Creating Resource Providers in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide. You can have a maximum of 50 resource type versions registered at a time. This maximum is per account and per region. Use DeregisterType to deregister specific resource type versions if necessary. Once you have initiated a registration request using  RegisterType , you can use  DescribeTypeRegistration  to monitor the progress of the registration request.

Required Parameters
SchemaHandlerPackage => A url to the S3 bucket containing the schema handler package that contains the schema, event handlers, and associated files for the type you want to register. For information on generating a schema handler package for the type you want to register, see submit in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide.  As part of registering a resource provider type, CloudFormation must be able to access the S3 bucket which contains the schema handler package for that resource provider. For more information, see IAM Permissions for Registering a Resource Provider in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. 
TypeName => The name of the type being registered. We recommend that type names adhere to the following pattern: company_or_organization::service::type.  The following organization namespaces are reserved and cannot be used in your resource type names:    Alexa     AMZN     Amazon     AWS     Custom     Dev

ClientRequestToken => A unique identifier that acts as an idempotency key for this registration request. Specifying a client request token prevents CloudFormation from generating more than one version of a type from the same registeration request, even if the request is submitted multiple times. 
ExecutionRoleArn => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation to assume when invoking the resource provider. If your resource type calls AWS APIs in any of its handlers, you must create an  IAM execution role  that includes the necessary permissions to call those AWS APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When CloudFormation needs to invoke the resource provider handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution role to create a temporary session token, which it then passes to the resource provider handler, thereby supplying your resource provider with the appropriate credentials.

    UpdateStack()

Updates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the stack update starts. You can check the status of the stack via the DescribeStacks action. To get a copy of the template for an existing stack, you can use the GetTemplate action. For more information about creating an update template, updating a stack, and monitoring the progress of the update, see Updating a Stack.

Required Parameters
StackName => The name or unique stack ID of the stack to update.

Optional Parameters
Capabilities => In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to update the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group      AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User      AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.  
ClientRequestToken => A unique identifier for this UpdateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might retry UpdateStack requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002. 
NotificationARNs => Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to remove all notification topics.
Parameters => A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.
ResourceTypes => The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this update stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or Custom::MyCustomInstance. If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management.
RoleARN => The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.
RollbackConfiguration => The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
StackPolicyBody => Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both. You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged.
StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody => Structure containing the temporary overriding stack policy body. You can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both. If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used.
StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL => Location of a file containing the temporary overriding stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both. If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used.
StackPolicyURL => Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both. You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged.
Tags => Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags. If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags. If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all associated tags.
TemplateBody => Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. (For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.) Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters: TemplateBody, TemplateURL, or set the UsePreviousTemplate to true.
TemplateURL => Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a template that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters: TemplateBody, TemplateURL, or set the UsePreviousTemplate to true.

    UpdateStackInstances()

Updates the parameter values for stack instances for the specified accounts, within the specified Regions. A stack instance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region.  You can only update stack instances in Regions and accounts where they already exist; to create additional stack instances, use CreateStackInstances.  During stack set updates, any parameters overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only update the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances.

Required Parameters
Regions => The names of one or more Regions in which you want to update parameter values for stack instances. The overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions.
StackSetName => The name or unique ID of the stack set associated with the stack instances.

Optional Parameters
Accounts => [Self-managed permissions] The names of one or more AWS accounts for which you want to update parameter values for stack instances. The overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not both.
DeploymentTargets => [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts for which you want to update parameter values for stack instances. If your update targets OUs, the overridden parameter values only apply to the accounts that are currently in the target OUs and their child OUs. Accounts added to the target OUs and their child OUs in the future won't use the overridden values. You can specify Accounts or DeploymentTargets, but not both.
OperationId => The unique identifier for this stack set operation.  The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically. 
OperationPreferences => Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.
ParameterOverrides =>  A list of input parameters whose values you want to update for the specified stack instances.  Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance update operations:   To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value.   To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of the following:   Do not include the parameter in the list.   Include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You cannot specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)     To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters.   To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not specify this property at all.   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set.

    UpdateStackSet()

Updates the stack set, and associated stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. Even if the stack set operation created by updating the stack set fails (completely or partially, below or above a specified failure tolerance), the stack set is updated with your changes. Subsequent CreateStackInstances calls on the specified stack set use the updated stack set.

Required Parameters
StackSetName => The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to update.

Optional Parameters
Accounts => [Self-managed permissions] The accounts in which to update associated stack instances. If you specify accounts, you must also specify the Regions in which to update stack set instances. To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify the Accounts or Regions properties. If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the Parameters property, AWS CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status. 
AdministrationRoleARN => The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the IAM role to use to update this stack set. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same administrator account. For more information, see Granting Permissions for Stack Set Operations in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. If you specified a customized administrator role when you created the stack set, you must specify a customized administrator role, even if it is the same customized administrator role used with this stack set previously.
AutoDeployment => [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to AWS Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization or organizational unit (OU). If you specify AutoDeployment, do not specify DeploymentTargets or Regions.
Capabilities => In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to update the stack set and its associated stack instances.

For those stacks sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some templates contain macros. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.  Stack sets do not currently support macros in stack templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability, if you include a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.   
DeploymentTargets => [Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts in which to update associated stack instances. To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify DeploymentTargets or Regions. If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if TemplateBody or TemplateURL is specified), or the Parameters, AWS CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status.
Description => A brief description of updates that you are making.
ExecutionRoleName => The name of the IAM execution role to use to update the stack set. If you do not specify an execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses the AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their stack sets.   If you specify a customized execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses that role to update the stack. If you do not specify a customized execution role, AWS CloudFormation performs the update using the role previously associated with the stack set, so long as you have permissions to perform operations on the stack set.
OperationId => The unique ID for this stack set operation.  The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that AWS CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify an operation ID, AWS CloudFormation generates one automatically. Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is OUTDATED. 
OperationPreferences => Preferences for how AWS CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.
Parameters => A list of input parameters for the stack set template. 
PermissionModel => Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are created. You cannot modify PermissionModel if there are stack instances associated with your stack set.   With self-managed permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions.   With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by AWS Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed Stack Set Permissions.  
Regions => The Regions in which to update associated stack instances. If you specify Regions, you must also specify accounts in which to update stack set instances. To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify the Accounts or Regions properties. If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the Parameters property, AWS CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, AWS CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status. 
Tags => The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created from it. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created in the stacks. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags. If you specify tags for this parameter, those tags replace any list of tags that are currently associated with this stack set. This means:   If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags.    If you specify any tags using this parameter, you must specify all the tags that you want associated with this stack set, even tags you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack set or during a previous update of the stack set.). Any tags that you don't include in the updated list of tags are removed from the stack set, and therefore from the stacks and resources as well.    If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all currently associated tags.   If you specify new tags as part of an UpdateStackSet action, AWS CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the stack set from the list of tags you specify, AWS CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources. If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire UpdateStackSet action fails with an access denied error, and the stack set is not updated.
TemplateBody => The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, see Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters: TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.
TemplateURL => The location of the file that contains the template body. The URL must point to a template (maximum size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters: TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true. 
UsePreviousTemplate => Use the existing template that's associated with the stack set that you're updating. Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters: TemplateBody or TemplateURL—or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.

    UpdateTerminationProtection()

Updates termination protection for the specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.  For nested stacks, termination protection is set on the root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.

Required Parameters
EnableTerminationProtection => Whether to enable termination protection on the specified stack.
StackName => The name or unique ID of the stack for which you want to set termination protection.

"""
    ValidateTemplate()

Validates a specified template. AWS CloudFormation first checks if the template is valid JSON. If it isn't, AWS CloudFormation checks if the template is valid YAML. If both these checks fail, AWS CloudFormation returns a template validation error.

Optional Parameters
TemplateBody => Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must pass TemplateURL or TemplateBody. If both are passed, only TemplateBody is used.
TemplateURL => Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must pass TemplateURL or TemplateBody. If both are passed, only TemplateBody is used.
