    create_access(external_id, role, server_id)
    create_access(external_id, role, server_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Used by administrators to choose which groups in the directory should have access to upload
and download files over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. For example, a
Microsoft Active Directory might contain 50,000 users, but only a small fraction might need
the ability to transfer files to the server. An administrator can use CreateAccess to limit
the access to the correct set of users who need this ability.

# Arguments
- `external_id`: A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within
  your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or
  Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the
  group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows
  PowerShell.  Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like \"YourGroupName*\"} -Properties * |
  Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid  In that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of
  your Active Directory group. The regular expression used to validate this parameter is a
  string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
  spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
- `role`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
  that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The
  policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your
  users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file
  system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to
  access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.
- `server_id`: A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the
  specific server that you added your user to.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"HomeDirectory"`: The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the
  server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.  The
  HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is set to PATH.
- `"HomeDirectoryMappings"`: Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or
  Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them
  visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made
  visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a
  target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when
  HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [
  { \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]  In most
  cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the
  designated home directory (\"chroot\"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target
  to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for
  chroot.  [ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]
- `"HomeDirectoryType"`: The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users'
  home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will
  see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol
  clients. If you set it to LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the
  HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to
  your users.  If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL, you must provide mappings, using the
  HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH, you
  provide an absolute path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both
  HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.
- `"Policy"`: A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access
  to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy
  include {Transfer:UserName}, {Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and {Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This
  policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use
  session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob,
  instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob
  and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Example session
  policy. For more information, see AssumeRole in the Security Token Service API Reference.
- `"PosixProfile"`:

    create_agreement(access_role, base_directory, local_profile_id, partner_profile_id, server_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an agreement. An agreement is a bilateral trading partner agreement, or
partnership, between an Transfer Family server and an AS2 process. The agreement defines
the file and message transfer relationship between the server and the AS2 process. To
define an agreement, Transfer Family combines a server, local profile, partner profile,
certificate, and other attributes. The partner is identified with the PartnerProfileId, and
the AS2 process is identified with the LocalProfileId.

# Arguments
- `access_role`: Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP protocol.
  For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access
  Management role to use.  For AS2 connectors  With AS2, you can send files by calling
  StartFileTransfer and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, SendFilePaths. We
  use the file’s parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt,
  parent directory is /bucket/dir/) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store
  the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing
  relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write
  access to the parent directory of the file location used in the StartFileTransfer request.
  Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the
  files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer. If you are using Basic authentication
  for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
  permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead
  of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the
  kms:Decrypt permission for that key.  For SFTP connectors  Make sure that the access role
  provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in
  the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides
  secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to Secrets Manager.
- `base_directory`: The landing directory (folder) for files transferred by using the AS2
  protocol. A BaseDirectory example is /DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/home/mydirectory.
- `local_profile_id`: A unique identifier for the AS2 local profile.
- `partner_profile_id`: A unique identifier for the partner profile used in the agreement.
- `server_id`: A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the
  specific server that the agreement uses.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: A name or short description to identify the agreement.
- `"Status"`: The status of the agreement. The agreement can be either ACTIVE or INACTIVE.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for agreements.

    create_connector(access_role, url)
    create_connector(access_role, url, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates the connector, which captures the parameters for a connection for the AS2 or SFTP
protocol. For AS2, the connector is required for sending files to an externally hosted AS2
server. For SFTP, the connector is required when sending files to an SFTP server or
receiving files from an SFTP server. For more details about connectors, see Configure AS2
connectors and Create SFTP connectors.  You must specify exactly one configuration object:
either for AS2 (As2Config) or SFTP (SftpConfig).

"""
    create_server()
    create_server(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Instantiates an auto-scaling virtual server based on the selected file transfer protocol in
Amazon Web Services. When you make updates to your file transfer protocol-enabled server or
when you work with users, use the service-generated ServerId property that is assigned to
the newly created server.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Certificate"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Certificate Manager (ACM)
  certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS. To request a new public certificate,
  see Request a public certificate in the Certificate Manager User Guide. To import an
  existing certificate into ACM, see Importing certificates into ACM in the Certificate
  Manager User Guide. To request a private certificate to use FTPS through private IP
  addresses, see Request a private certificate in the Certificate Manager User Guide.
  Certificates with the following cryptographic algorithms and key sizes are supported:
  2048-bit RSA (RSA_2048)   4096-bit RSA (RSA_4096)   Elliptic Prime Curve 256 bit
  (EC_prime256v1)   Elliptic Prime Curve 384 bit (EC_secp384r1)   Elliptic Prime Curve 521
  bit (EC_secp521r1)    The certificate must be a valid SSL/TLS X.509 version 3 certificate
  with FQDN or IP address specified and information about the issuer.
- `"Domain"`: The domain of the storage system that is used for file transfers. There are
  two domains available: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic File
  System (Amazon EFS). The default value is S3.  After the server is created, the domain
  cannot be changed.
- `"EndpointDetails"`: The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are
  configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make your
  endpoint accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP
  addresses and make your endpoint accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's
  default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.
- `"EndpointType"`: The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose
  to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC.
  With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and
  resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP
  addresses directly to it.   After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using
  EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account if your account hasn't
  already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with
  EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021,
  you will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType=VPC. For more information, see
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vp
  c-endpoint. It is recommended that you use VPC as the EndpointType. With this endpoint
  type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP
  included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by
  the client's public IP address. This is not possible with EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT.
- `"HostKey"`: The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your SFTP-enabled server.
  You can add multiple host keys, in case you want to rotate keys, or have a set of active
  keys that use different algorithms. Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit
  key with no passphrase:  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N \"\" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Use
  a minimum value of 2048 for the -b option. You can create a stronger key by using 3072 or
  4096. Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase:
  ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N \"\" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Valid values for the -b
  option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521. Use the following command to generate an ED25519
  key with no passphrase:  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N \"\" -f my-new-server-key. For all of
  these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a string of your choice.  If you
  aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new
  server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be
  disruptive.  For more information, see Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled server in the
  Transfer Family User Guide.
- `"IdentityProviderDetails"`: Required when IdentityProviderType is set to
  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, Amazon Web Services_LAMBDA or API_GATEWAY. Accepts an array
  containing all of the information required to use a directory in AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or
  invoke a customer-supplied authentication API, including the API Gateway URL. Not required
  when IdentityProviderType is set to SERVICE_MANAGED.
- `"IdentityProviderType"`: The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is
  SERVICE_MANAGED, which allows you to store and access user credentials within the Transfer
  Family service. Use AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Directory groups in
  Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your
  on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services using AD Connector. This option also
  requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter. Use
  the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The
  API_GATEWAY setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for
  authentication by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter. Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to
  directly use an Lambda function as your identity provider. If you choose this value, you
  must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the Function parameter for the
  IdentityProviderDetails data type.
- `"LoggingRole"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or
  Amazon EFSevents. When set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.
- `"PostAuthenticationLoginBanner"`: Specifies a string to display when users connect to a
  server. This string is displayed after the user authenticates.  The SFTP protocol does not
  support post-authentication display banners.
- `"PreAuthenticationLoginBanner"`: Specifies a string to display when users connect to a
  server. This string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the following
  banner displays details about using the system:  This system is for the use of authorized
  users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their
  authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and
  recorded by system personnel.
- `"ProtocolDetails"`: The protocol settings that are configured for your server.    To
  indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the PassiveIp parameter. Enter a
  single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or
  load balancer.    To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use the
  SETSTAT command on a file that you are uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket, use the
  SetStatOption parameter. To have the Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command and
  upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to
  ENABLE_NO_OP. If you set the SetStatOption parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP, Transfer Family
  generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client
  is making a SETSTAT call.   To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes
  recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the TlsSessionResumptionMode
  parameter.    As2Transports indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages. Currently,
  only HTTP is supported.
- `"Protocols"`: Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file
  transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols
  are:    SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH    FTPS
  (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption    FTP (File Transfer
  Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer    AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for
  transporting structured business-to-business data      If you select FTPS, you must choose
  a certificate stored in Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server
  when clients connect to it over FTPS.   If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS, then the
  EndpointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be either AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE,
  AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.   If Protocol includes FTP, then AddressAllocationIds cannot be
  associated.   If Protocol is set only to SFTP, the EndpointType can be set to PUBLIC and
  the IdentityProviderType can be set any of the supported identity types: SERVICE_MANAGED,
  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.   If Protocol includes AS2, then the
  EndpointType must be VPC, and domain must be Amazon S3.
- `"S3StorageOptions"`: Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories
  is optimized. This is disabled by default. By default, home directory mappings have a TYPE
  of DIRECTORY. If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the
  HomeDirectoryMapEntry Type to FILE if you want a mapping to have a file target.
- `"SecurityPolicyName"`: Specifies the name of the security policy for the server.
- `"StructuredLogDestinations"`: Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are
  sent. To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log group. In this
  case, the format of the log group is as follows:
  arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*  For example,
  arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*  If you have previously
  specified a log group for a server, you can clear it, and in effect turn off structured
  logging, by providing an empty value for this parameter in an update-server call. For
  example:  update-server --server-id s-1234567890abcdef0 --structured-log-destinations
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for servers.
- `"WorkflowDetails"`: Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the
  execution role that's used for executing the workflow. In addition to a workflow to execute
  when a file is uploaded completely, WorkflowDetails can also contain a workflow ID (and
  execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when
  the server session disconnects while the file is still being uploaded.

to SERVICE_MANAGED. Using parameters for CreateUser, you can specify the user name, set the
home directory, store the user's public key, and assign the user's Identity and Access
Management (IAM) role. You can also optionally add a session policy, and assign metadata
with tags that can be used to group and search for users.

# Arguments
- `role`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
  that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The
  policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your
  users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file
  system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to
  access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.
- `server_id`: A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the
  specific server that you added your user to.
- `user_name`: A unique string that identifies a user and is associated with a ServerId.
  This user name must be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 100 characters long. The following
  are valid characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore '_', hyphen '-', period '.', and at sign
  '@'. The user name can't start with a hyphen, period, or at sign.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"HomeDirectory"`: The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the
  server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.  The
  HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is set to PATH.
- `"HomeDirectoryMappings"`: Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or
  Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them
  visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made
  visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a
  target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when
  HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [
  { \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]  In most
  cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock your user down to the
  designated home directory (\"chroot\"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target
  to the value the user should see for their home directory when they log in. The following
  is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot.  [ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\":
  \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]
- `"HomeDirectoryType"`: The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users'
  home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will
  see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol
  clients. If you set it to LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the
  HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to
  your users.  If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL, you must provide mappings, using the
  HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH, you
  provide an absolute path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both
  HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.
- `"Policy"`: A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access
  to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy
  include {Transfer:UserName}, {Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and {Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This
  policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use
  session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob,
  instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob
  and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Example session
  policy. For more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web Services Security Token
  Service API Reference.
- `"PosixProfile"`: Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid), group ID
  (Gid), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids), that controls your users' access to
  your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories
  in Amazon EFS determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and
  out of your Amazon EFS file systems.
- `"SshPublicKeyBody"`: The public portion of the Secure Shell (SSH) key used to
  authenticate the user to the server. The three standard SSH public key format elements are
  &lt;key type&gt;, &lt;body base64&gt;, and an optional &lt;comment&gt;, with spaces between
  each element. Transfer Family accepts RSA, ECDSA, and ED25519 keys.   For RSA keys, the key
  type is ssh-rsa.   For ED25519 keys, the key type is ssh-ed25519.   For ECDSA keys, the key
  type is either ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, or ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, depending
  on the size of the key you generated.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for users. Tags are
  metadata attached to users for any purpose.

    create_workflow(steps)
    create_workflow(steps, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 Allows you to create a workflow with specified steps and step details the workflow invokes

created with any transfer servers by specifying the workflow-details field in CreateServer
and UpdateServer operations.

# Arguments
- `steps`: Specifies the details for the steps that are in the specified workflow.  The
  TYPE specifies which of the following actions is being taken for this step.      COPY  -
  Copy the file to another location.     CUSTOM  - Perform a custom step with an Lambda
  function target.     DECRYPT  - Decrypt a file that was encrypted before it was uploaded.
    DELETE  - Delete the file.     TAG  - Add a tag to the file.     Currently, copying and
  tagging are supported only on S3.    For file location, you specify either the Amazon S3
  bucket and key, or the Amazon EFS file system ID and path.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: A textual description for the workflow.
- `"OnExceptionSteps"`: Specifies the steps (actions) to take if errors are encountered
  during execution of the workflow.  For custom steps, the Lambda function needs to send
  FAILURE to the call back API to kick off the exception steps. Additionally, if the Lambda
  does not send SUCCESS before it times out, the exception steps are executed.
- `"Tags"`: Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for workflows. Tags are
  metadata attached to workflows for any purpose.

optional MaxItems value to control the maximum number of items that are listed from the
remote directory. This API returns a list of all files and directories in the remote
directory (up to the maximum value), but does not return files or folders in
sub-directories. That is, it only returns a list of files and directories one-level deep.
After you receive the listing file, you can provide the files that you want to transfer to
the RetrieveFilePaths parameter of the StartFileTransfer API call. The naming convention
for the output file is  connector-ID-listing-ID.json. The output file contains the
following information:    filePath: the complete path of a remote file, relative to the
directory of the listing request for your SFTP connector on the remote server.
modifiedTimestamp: the last time the file was modified, in UTC time format. This field is
optional. If the remote file attributes don't contain a timestamp, it is omitted from the
file listing.    size: the size of the file, in bytes. This field is optional. If the
remote file attributes don't contain a file size, it is omitted from the file listing.
path: the complete path of a remote directory, relative to the directory of the listing
request for your SFTP connector on the remote server.    truncated: a flag indicating
whether the list output contains all of the items contained in the remote directory or not.
If your Truncated output value is true, you can increase the value provided in the optional
max-items input attribute to be able to list more items (up to the maximum allowed list
size of 10,000 items).

# Arguments
- `connector_id`: The unique identifier for the connector.
- `output_directory_path`: Specifies the path (bucket and prefix) in Amazon S3 storage to
  store the results of the directory listing.
- `remote_directory_path`: Specifies the directory on the remote SFTP server for which you
  want to list its contents.

If the IdentityProviderType of a file transfer protocol-enabled server is
AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or API_Gateway, tests whether your identity provider is set up
successfully. We highly recommend that you call this operation to test your authentication
method as soon as you create your server. By doing so, you can troubleshoot issues with the
identity provider integration to ensure that your users can successfully use the service.
The ServerId and UserName parameters are required. The ServerProtocol, SourceIp, and
UserPassword are all optional.  Note the following:    You cannot use TestIdentityProvider
if the IdentityProviderType of your server is SERVICE_MANAGED.    TestIdentityProvider does
not work with keys: it only accepts passwords.    TestIdentityProvider can test the
password operation for a custom Identity Provider that handles keys and passwords.    If
you provide any incorrect values for any parameters, the Response field is empty.     If
you provide a server ID for a server that uses service-managed users, you get an error:
An error occurred (InvalidRequestException) when calling the TestIdentityProvider
operation: s-server-ID not configured for external auth      If you enter a Server ID for
the --server-id parameter that does not identify an actual Transfer server, you receive the
following error:   An error occurred (ResourceNotFoundException) when calling the
TestIdentityProvider operation: Unknown server.  It is possible your sever is in a
different region. You can specify a region by adding the following: --region region-code,
such as --region us-east-2 to specify a server in US East (Ohio).

# Arguments
- `server_id`: A system-assigned identifier for a specific server. That server's user
  authentication method is tested with a user name and password.
- `user_name`: The name of the account to be tested.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ServerProtocol"`: The type of file transfer protocol to be tested. The available
  protocols are:   Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)   File Transfer Protocol
  Secure (FTPS)   File Transfer Protocol (FTP)   Applicability Statement 2 (AS2)
- `"SourceIp"`: The source IP address of the account to be tested.
- `"UserPassword"`: The password of the account to be tested.

"""
    update_access(external_id, server_id)
    update_access(external_id, server_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Allows you to update parameters for the access specified in the ServerID and ExternalID
parameters.

# Arguments
- `external_id`: A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within
  your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or
  Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the
  group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows
  PowerShell.  Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like \"YourGroupName*\"} -Properties * |
  Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid  In that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of
  your Active Directory group. The regular expression used to validate this parameter is a
  string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
  spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
- `server_id`: A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the
  specific server that you added your user to.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"HomeDirectory"`: The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the
  server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.  The
  HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is set to PATH.
- `"HomeDirectoryMappings"`: Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or
  Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them
  visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made
  visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a
  target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when
  HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [
  { \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]  In most
  cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the
  designated home directory (\"chroot\"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target
  to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for
  chroot.  [ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]
- `"HomeDirectoryType"`: The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users'
  home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will
  see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol
  clients. If you set it to LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the
  HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to
  your users.  If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL, you must provide mappings, using the
  HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH, you
  provide an absolute path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both
  HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.
- `"Policy"`: A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access
  to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy
  include {Transfer:UserName}, {Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and {Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This
  policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use
  session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob,
  instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob
  and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Example session
  policy. For more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web ServicesSecurity Token
  Service API Reference.
- `"PosixProfile"`:
- `"Role"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
  that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The
  policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your
  users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file
  system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to
  access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AccessRole"`: Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP protocol.
  For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access
  Management role to use.  For AS2 connectors  With AS2, you can send files by calling
  StartFileTransfer and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, SendFilePaths. We
  use the file’s parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt,
  parent directory is /bucket/dir/) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store
  the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing
  relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write
  access to the parent directory of the file location used in the StartFileTransfer request.
  Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the
  files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer. If you are using Basic authentication
  for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
  permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead
  of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the
  kms:Decrypt permission for that key.  For SFTP connectors  Make sure that the access role
  provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in
  the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides
  secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to Secrets Manager.
- `"BaseDirectory"`: To change the landing directory (folder) for files that are
  transferred, provide the bucket folder that you want to use; for example,
  /DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/home/mydirectory .
- `"Description"`: To replace the existing description, provide a short description for the
  agreement.
- `"LocalProfileId"`: A unique identifier for the AS2 local profile. To change the local
  profile identifier, provide a new value here.
- `"PartnerProfileId"`: A unique identifier for the partner profile. To change the partner
  profile identifier, provide a new value here.
- `"Status"`: You can update the status for the agreement, either activating an inactive
  agreement or the reverse.

  a valid SSL/TLS X.509 version 3 certificate with FQDN or IP address specified and
  information about the issuer.
- `"EndpointDetails"`: The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are
  configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make your
  endpoint accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP
  addresses and make your endpoint accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's
  default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.
- `"EndpointType"`: The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose
  to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC.
  With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and
  resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP
  addresses directly to it.   After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using
  EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount if your account hasn't already
  done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with
  EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount on or before May 19, 2021, you
  will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType=VPC. For more information, see
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vp
  c-endpoint. It is recommended that you use VPC as the EndpointType. With this endpoint
  type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP
  included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by
  the client's public IP address. This is not possible with EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT.
- `"HostKey"`: The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your SFTP-enabled server.
  You can add multiple host keys, in case you want to rotate keys, or have a set of active
  keys that use different algorithms. Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit
  key with no passphrase:  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N \"\" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Use
  a minimum value of 2048 for the -b option. You can create a stronger key by using 3072 or
  4096. Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase:
  ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N \"\" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Valid values for the -b
  option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521. Use the following command to generate an ED25519
  key with no passphrase:  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N \"\" -f my-new-server-key. For all of
  these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a string of your choice.  If you
  aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new
  server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be
  disruptive.  For more information, see Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled server in the
  Transfer Family User Guide.
- `"IdentityProviderDetails"`: An array containing all of the information required to call
  a customer's authentication API method.
- `"LoggingRole"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or
  Amazon EFSevents. When set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.
- `"PostAuthenticationLoginBanner"`: Specifies a string to display when users connect to a
  server. This string is displayed after the user authenticates.  The SFTP protocol does not
  support post-authentication display banners.
- `"PreAuthenticationLoginBanner"`: Specifies a string to display when users connect to a
  server. This string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the following
  banner displays details about using the system:  This system is for the use of authorized
  users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their
  authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and
  recorded by system personnel.
- `"ProtocolDetails"`: The protocol settings that are configured for your server.    To
  indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the PassiveIp parameter. Enter a
  single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or
  load balancer.    To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use the
  SETSTAT command on a file that you are uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket, use the
  SetStatOption parameter. To have the Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command and
  upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to
  ENABLE_NO_OP. If you set the SetStatOption parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP, Transfer Family
  generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client
  is making a SETSTAT call.   To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes
  recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the TlsSessionResumptionMode
  parameter.    As2Transports indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages. Currently,
  only HTTP is supported.
- `"Protocols"`: Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file
  transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols
  are:    SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH    FTPS
  (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption    FTP (File Transfer
  Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer    AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for
  transporting structured business-to-business data      If you select FTPS, you must choose
  a certificate stored in Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server
  when clients connect to it over FTPS.   If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS, then the
  EndpointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be either AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE,
  AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.   If Protocol includes FTP, then AddressAllocationIds cannot be
  associated.   If Protocol is set only to SFTP, the EndpointType can be set to PUBLIC and
  the IdentityProviderType can be set any of the supported identity types: SERVICE_MANAGED,
  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.   If Protocol includes AS2, then the
  EndpointType must be VPC, and domain must be Amazon S3.
- `"S3StorageOptions"`: Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories
  is optimized. This is disabled by default. By default, home directory mappings have a TYPE
  of DIRECTORY. If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the
  HomeDirectoryMapEntry Type to FILE if you want a mapping to have a file target.
- `"SecurityPolicyName"`: Specifies the name of the security policy for the server.
- `"StructuredLogDestinations"`: Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are
  sent. To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log group. In this
  case, the format of the log group is as follows:
  arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*  For example,
  arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*  If you have previously
  specified a log group for a server, you can clear it, and in effect turn off structured
  logging, by providing an empty value for this parameter in an update-server call. For
  example:  update-server --server-id s-1234567890abcdef0 --structured-log-destinations
- `"WorkflowDetails"`: Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the
  execution role that's used for executing the workflow. In addition to a workflow to execute
  when a file is uploaded completely, WorkflowDetails can also contain a workflow ID (and
  execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when
  the server session disconnects while the file is still being uploaded. To remove an
  associated workflow from a server, you can provide an empty OnUpload object, as in the
  following example.  aws transfer update-server --server-id s-01234567890abcdef
  --workflow-details '{\"OnUpload\":[]}'

    update_user(server_id, user_name)
    update_user(server_id, user_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Assigns new properties to a user. Parameters you pass modify any or all of the following:
the home directory, role, and policy for the UserName and ServerId you specify. The
response returns the ServerId and the UserName for the updated user. In the console, you
can select Restricted when you create or update a user. This ensures that the user can't
access anything outside of their home directory. The programmatic way to configure this
behavior is to update the user. Set their HomeDirectoryType to LOGICAL, and specify
HomeDirectoryMappings with Entry as root (/) and Target as their home directory. For
example, if the user's home directory is /test/admin-user, the following command updates
the user so that their configuration in the console shows the Restricted flag as selected.
 aws transfer update-user --server-id &lt;server-id&gt; --user-name admin-user
--home-directory-type LOGICAL --home-directory-mappings \"[{\"Entry\":\"/\",
\"Target\":\"/test/admin-user\"}]\"

# Arguments
- `server_id`: A system-assigned unique identifier for a Transfer Family server instance
  that the user is assigned to.
- `user_name`: A unique string that identifies a user and is associated with a server as
  specified by the ServerId. This user name must be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 100
  characters long. The following are valid characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore '_', hyphen
  '-', period '.', and at sign '@'. The user name can't start with a hyphen, period, or at
  sign.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"HomeDirectory"`: The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the
  server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.  The
  HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is set to PATH.
- `"HomeDirectoryMappings"`: Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or
  Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them
  visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made
  visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a
  target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when
  HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [
  { \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]  In most
  cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the
  designated home directory (\"chroot\"). To do this, you can set Entry to '/' and set Target
  to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for
  chroot.  [ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]
- `"HomeDirectoryType"`: The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users'
  home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will
  see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol
  clients. If you set it to LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the
  HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to
  your users.  If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL, you must provide mappings, using the
  HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH, you
  provide an absolute path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both
  HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.
- `"Policy"`: A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access
  to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy
  include {Transfer:UserName}, {Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and {Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This
  policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use
  session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob,
  instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob
  and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Creating a
  session policy. For more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web Services Security
  Token Service API Reference.
- `"PosixProfile"`: Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid), group ID
  (Gid), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids), that controls your users' access to
  your Amazon Elastic File Systems (Amazon EFS). The POSIX permissions that are set on files
  and directories in your file system determines the level of access your users get when
  transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.
- `"Role"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
  that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The
  policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your
  users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file
  system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to
  access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.
