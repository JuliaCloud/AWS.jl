    AddJobFlowSteps()

AddJobFlowSteps adds new steps to a running cluster. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow. If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using SSH to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. For more information on how to do this, see Add More than 256 Steps to a Cluster in the Amazon EMR Management Guide. A step specifies the location of a JAR file stored either on the master node of the cluster or in Amazon S3. Each step is performed by the main function of the main class of the JAR file. The main class can be specified either in the manifest of the JAR or by using the MainFunction parameter of the step. Amazon EMR executes each step in the order listed. For a step to be considered complete, the main function must exit with a zero exit code and all Hadoop jobs started while the step was running must have completed and run successfully. You can only add steps to a cluster that is in one of the following states: STARTING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING, or WAITING.

# Required Parameters
- `JobFlowId`: A string that uniquely identifies the job flow. This identifier is returned by RunJobFlow and can also be obtained from ListClusters. 
- `Steps`:  A list of StepConfig to be executed by the job flow.

SetTerminationProtection is used to prevent accidental termination of a cluster and to ensure that in the event of an error, the instances persist so that you can recover any data stored in their ephemeral instance storage.  To terminate a cluster that has been locked by setting SetTerminationProtection to true, you must first unlock the job flow by a subsequent call to SetTerminationProtection in which you set the value to false.   For more information, seeManaging Cluster Termination in the Amazon EMR Management Guide. 

# Required Parameters
- `JobFlowIds`:  A list of strings that uniquely identify the clusters to protect. This identifier is returned by RunJobFlow and can also be obtained from DescribeJobFlows . 
- `TerminationProtected`: A Boolean that indicates whether to protect the cluster and prevent the Amazon EC2 instances in the cluster from shutting down due to API calls, user intervention, or job-flow error.

    SetVisibleToAllUsers()

Sets the Cluster VisibleToAllUsers value, which determines whether the cluster is visible to all IAM users of the AWS account associated with the cluster. Only the IAM user who created the cluster or the AWS account root user can call this action. The default value, true, indicates that all IAM users in the AWS account can perform cluster actions if they have the proper IAM policy permissions. If set to false, only the IAM user that created the cluster can perform actions. This action works on running clusters. You can override the default true setting when you create a cluster by using the VisibleToAllUsers parameter with RunJobFlow.

# Required Parameters
- `JobFlowIds`: The unique identifier of the job flow (cluster).
- `VisibleToAllUsers`: A value of true indicates that all IAM users in the AWS account can perform cluster actions if they have the proper IAM policy permissions. This is the default. A value of false indicates that only the IAM user who created the cluster can perform actions.

    TerminateJobFlows()

TerminateJobFlows shuts a list of clusters (job flows) down. When a job flow is shut down, any step not yet completed is canceled and the EC2 instances on which the cluster is running are stopped. Any log files not already saved are uploaded to Amazon S3 if a LogUri was specified when the cluster was created. The maximum number of clusters allowed is 10. The call to TerminateJobFlows is asynchronous. Depending on the configuration of the cluster, it may take up to 1-5 minutes for the cluster to completely terminate and release allocated resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

# Required Parameters
- `JobFlowIds`: A list of job flows to be shutdown.
