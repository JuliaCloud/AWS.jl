    add_layer_version_permission(action, layer_name, principal, statement_id, version_number; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Adds permissions to the resource-based policy of a version of an Lambda layer. Use this
action to grant layer usage permission to other accounts. You can grant permission to a
single account, all accounts in an organization, or all Amazon Web Services accounts.  To
revoke permission, call RemoveLayerVersionPermission with the statement ID that you
specified when you added it.

# Arguments
- `action`: The API action that grants access to the layer. For example,
  lambda:GetLayerVersion.
- `layer_name`: The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the layer.
- `principal`: An account ID, or * to grant layer usage permission to all accounts in an
  organization, or all Amazon Web Services accounts (if organizationId is not specified). For
  the last case, make sure that you really do want all Amazon Web Services accounts to have
  usage permission to this layer.
- `statement_id`: An identifier that distinguishes the policy from others on the same layer
  version.
- `version_number`: The version number.

# Keyword Parameters
- `organization_id`: With the principal set to *, grant permission to all accounts in the
  specified organization.
- `revision_id`: Only update the policy if the revision ID matches the ID specified. Use
  this option to avoid modifying a policy that has changed since you last read it.

end

"""
    add_permission(action, function_name, principal, statement_id; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Grants an Amazon Web Services service or another account permission to use a function. You
can apply the policy at the function level, or specify a qualifier to restrict access to a
single version or alias. If you use a qualifier, the invoker must use the full Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) of that version or alias to invoke the function. Note: Lambda does not
support adding policies to version LATEST. To grant permission to another account, specify
the account ID as the Principal. For Amazon Web Services services, the principal is a
domain-style identifier defined by the service, like s3.amazonaws.com or sns.amazonaws.com.
For Amazon Web Services services, you can also specify the ARN of the associated resource
as the SourceArn. If you grant permission to a service principal without specifying the
source, other accounts could potentially configure resources in their account to invoke
your Lambda function. This action adds a statement to a resource-based permissions policy
for the function. For more information about function policies, see Lambda Function
Policies.

# Arguments
- `action`: The action that the principal can use on the function. For example,
  lambda:InvokeFunction or lambda:GetFunction.
- `function_name`: The name of the Lambda function, version, or alias.  Name formats
  Function name - my-function (name-only), my-function:v1 (with alias).    Function ARN -
  arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function.    Partial ARN -
  123456789012:function:my-function.   You can append a version number or alias to any of the
  formats. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the
  function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.
- `principal`: The Amazon Web Services service or account that invokes the function. If you
  specify a service, use SourceArn or SourceAccount to limit who can invoke the function
  through that service.
- `statement_id`: A statement identifier that differentiates the statement from others in
  the same policy.

# Keyword Parameters
- `event_source_token`: For Alexa Smart Home functions, a token that must be supplied by
  the invoker.
- `qualifier`: Specify a version or alias to add permissions to a published version of the
  function.
- `revision_id`: Only update the policy if the revision ID matches the ID that's specified.
  Use this option to avoid modifying a policy that has changed since you last read it.
- `source_account`: For Amazon S3, the ID of the account that owns the resource. Use this
  together with SourceArn to ensure that the resource is owned by the specified account. It
  is possible for an Amazon S3 bucket to be deleted by its owner and recreated by another
  account.
- `source_arn`: For Amazon Web Services services, the ARN of the Amazon Web Services
  resource that invokes the function. For example, an Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon SNS topic.
  Note that Lambda configures the comparison using the StringLike operator.

end

"""
    create_function(code, function_name, role; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a deployment package and an
execution role. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that
contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use
Amazon Web Services services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray
for request tracing. You set the package type to Image if the deployment package is a
container image. For a container image, the code property must include the URI of a
container image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler and
runtime properties.  You set the package type to Zip if the deployment package is a .zip
file archive. For a .zip file archive, the code property specifies the location of the .zip
file. You must also specify the handler and runtime properties. The code in the deployment
package must be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function
(x86-64 or arm64). If you do not specify the architecture, the default value is x86-64.
When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its
supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute or
so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The State, StateReason, and
StateReasonCode fields in the response from GetFunctionConfiguration indicate when the
function is ready to invoke. For more information, see Function States. A function has an
unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version
changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a
snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named
resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the
Publish parameter to create version 1 of your function from its initial configuration. The
other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can
modify version-specific settings later with UpdateFunctionConfiguration. Function-level
settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include
tags (TagResource) and per-function concurrency limits (PutFunctionConcurrency). You can
use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing
for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to
deploy a code package with UpdateFunctionCode, Lambda checks that the code package has a
valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes set set
of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function. If another
account or an Amazon Web Services service invokes your function, use AddPermission to grant
permission by creating a resource-based IAM policy. You can grant permissions at the
function level, on a version, or on an alias. To invoke your function directly, use Invoke.
To invoke your function in response to events in other Amazon Web Services services, create
an event source mapping (CreateEventSourceMapping), or configure a function trigger in the
other service. For more information, see Invoking Functions.

# Arguments

  where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing. For more information, see
  Dead Letter Queues.
- `description`: A description of the function.
- `environment`: Environment variables that are accessible from function code during
  execution.
- `file_system_configs`: Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system.
- `handler`: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute your

  the runtime. For more information, see Programming Model.
- `image_config`: Container image configuration values that override the values in the
  container image Dockerfile.
- `kmskey_arn`: The ARN of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that's
  used to encrypt your function's environment variables. If it's not provided, Lambda uses a
  default service key.
- `layers`: A list of function layers to add to the function's execution environment.
  Specify each layer by its ARN, including the version.
- `memory_size`: The amount of memory available to the function at runtime. Increasing the
  function memory also increases its CPU allocation. The default value is 128 MB. The value
  can be any multiple of 1 MB.

  Zip for ZIP archive.
- `publish`: Set to true to publish the first version of the function during creation.
- `runtime`: The identifier of the function's runtime. Runtime is required if the
  deployment package is a .zip file archive.
- `tags`: A list of tags to apply to the function.
- `timeout`: The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run before
  stopping it. The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed value is 900 seconds. For
  additional information, see Lambda execution environment.
- `tracing_config`: Set Mode to Active to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests
  with X-Ray.
- `vpc_config`: For network connectivity to Amazon Web Services resources in a VPC, specify
  a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC. When you connect a function to a VPC, it
  can only access resources and the internet through that VPC. For more information, see VPC
  Settings.

"""
    invoke(function_name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the
response), or asynchronously. To invoke a function asynchronously, set InvocationType to
Event. For synchronous invocation, details about the function response, including errors,
are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find
more information in the execution log and trace. When an error occurs, your function may be
invoked multiple times. Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and
invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an
error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more information, see Retry
Behavior. For asynchronous invocation, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to
your function. If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue,
events may be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times,
even if no error occurs. To retain events that were not processed, configure your function
with a dead-letter queue. The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function
errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such
as permissions errors, limit errors, or issues with your function's code and configuration.
For example, Lambda returns TooManyRequestsException if executing the function would cause
you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level
(ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded) or function level
(ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded). For functions with a long timeout,
your client might be disconnected during synchronous invocation while it waits for a
response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow
for long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings. This operation requires
permission for the lambda:InvokeFunction action.

# Arguments
- `function_name`: The name of the Lambda function, version, or alias.  Name formats
  Function name - my-function (name-only), my-function:v1 (with alias).    Function ARN -

  formats. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the
  function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

# Keyword Parameters
- `client_context`: Up to 3583 bytes of base64-encoded data about the invoking client to
  pass to the function in the context object.
- `invocation_type`: Choose from the following options.    RequestResponse (default) -
  Invoke the function synchronously. Keep the connection open until the function returns a
  response or times out. The API response includes the function response and additional data.
     Event - Invoke the function asynchronously. Send events that fail multiple times to the
  function's dead-letter queue (if it's configured). The API response only includes a status
  code.    DryRun - Validate parameter values and verify that the user or role has permission
  to invoke the function.
- `log_type`: Set to Tail to include the execution log in the response. Applies to
  synchronously invoked functions only.
- `payload`: The JSON that you want to provide to your Lambda function as input. You can
  enter the JSON directly. For example, --payload '{ \"key\": \"value\" }'. You can also

Sets the maximum number of simultaneous executions for a function, and reserves capacity

including all published versions and the unpublished version. Reserving concurrency both
ensures that your function has capacity to process the specified number of events
simultaneously, and prevents it from scaling beyond that level. Use GetFunction to see the
current setting for a function. Use GetAccountSettings to see your Regional concurrency
limit. You can reserve concurrency for as many functions as you like, as long as you leave
at least 100 simultaneous executions unreserved for functions that aren't configured with a

    put_function_event_invoke_config(function_name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Configures options for asynchronous invocation on a function, version, or alias. If a
configuration already exists for a function, version, or alias, this operation overwrites
it. If you exclude any settings, they are removed. To set one option without affecting
existing settings for other options, use UpdateFunctionEventInvokeConfig. By default,
Lambda retries an asynchronous invocation twice if the function returns an error. It
retains events in a queue for up to six hours. When an event fails all processing attempts
or stays in the asynchronous invocation queue for too long, Lambda discards it. To retain
discarded events, configure a dead-letter queue with UpdateFunctionConfiguration. To send
an invocation record to a queue, topic, function, or event bus, specify a destination. You
can configure separate destinations for successful invocations (on-success) and events that
fail all processing attempts (on-failure). You can configure destinations in addition to or
instead of a dead-letter queue.

# Arguments

"""
    update_function_configuration(function_name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Modify the version-specific settings of a Lambda function. When you update a function,
Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your
function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute. During this time, you can't
modify the function, but you can still invoke it. The LastUpdateStatus,
LastUpdateStatusReason, and LastUpdateStatusReasonCode fields in the response from
GetFunctionConfiguration indicate when the update is complete and the function is
processing events with the new configuration. For more information, see Function States.
These settings can vary between versions of a function and are locked when you publish a
version. You can't modify the configuration of a published version, only the unpublished
version. To configure function concurrency, use PutFunctionConcurrency. To grant invoke
permissions to an account or Amazon Web Services service, use AddPermission.

# Arguments
- `function_name`: The name of the Lambda function.  Name formats     Function name -
  my-function.    Function ARN - arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function.
    Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:my-function.   The length constraint applies only to
  the full ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in
  length.

# Keyword Parameters
- `dead_letter_config`: A dead letter queue configuration that specifies the queue or topic
  where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing. For more information, see
  Dead Letter Queues.
- `description`: A description of the function.
- `environment`: Environment variables that are accessible from function code during
  execution.
- `file_system_configs`: Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system.
- `handler`: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute your
  function. Handler is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. The format
  includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on
  the runtime. For more information, see Programming Model.
- `image_config`:  Container image configuration values that override the values in the
  container image Docker file.
- `kmskey_arn`: The ARN of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that's
  used to encrypt your function's environment variables. If it's not provided, Lambda uses a
  default service key.
- `layers`: A list of function layers to add to the function's execution environment.
  Specify each layer by its ARN, including the version.
- `memory_size`: The amount of memory available to the function at runtime. Increasing the
  function memory also increases its CPU allocation. The default value is 128 MB. The value
  can be any multiple of 1 MB.
- `revision_id`: Only update the function if the revision ID matches the ID that's
  specified. Use this option to avoid modifying a function that has changed since you last
  read it.
- `role`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function's execution role.
- `runtime`: The identifier of the function's runtime. Runtime is required if the
  deployment package is a .zip file archive.
- `timeout`: The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run before
  stopping it. The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed value is 900 seconds. For
  additional information, see Lambda execution environment.
- `tracing_config`: Set Mode to Active to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests
  with X-Ray.
- `vpc_config`: For network connectivity to Amazon Web Services resources in a VPC, specify
  a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC. When you connect a function to a VPC, it
  can only access resources and the internet through that VPC. For more information, see VPC
  Settings.

"""
    update_function_event_invoke_config(function_name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Updates the configuration for asynchronous invocation for a function, version, or alias. To
configure options for asynchronous invocation, use PutFunctionEventInvokeConfig.

# Arguments
- `function_name`: The name of the Lambda function, version, or alias.  Name formats
  Function name - my-function (name-only), my-function:v1 (with alias).    Function ARN -
  arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function.    Partial ARN -
  123456789012:function:my-function.   You can append a version number or alias to any of the
  formats. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the
  function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

# Keyword Parameters
- `destination_config`: A destination for events after they have been sent to a function
  for processing.  Destinations     Function - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Lambda
  function.    Queue - The ARN of an SQS queue.    Topic - The ARN of an SNS topic.    Event
  Bus - The ARN of an Amazon EventBridge event bus.
- `maximum_event_age_in_seconds`: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a
  function for processing.
- `maximum_retry_attempts`: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns
  an error.
- `qualifier`: A version number or alias name.
