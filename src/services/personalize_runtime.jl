    get_personalized_ranking(campaign_arn, input_list, user_id)
    get_personalized_ranking(campaign_arn, input_list, user_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Re-ranks a list of recommended items for the given user. The first item in the list is
deemed the most likely item to be of interest to the user.  The solution backing the
campaign must have been created using a recipe of type PERSONALIZED_RANKING.

# Arguments
- `campaign_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign to use for generating the
  personalized ranking.
- `input_list`: A list of items (by itemId) to rank. If an item was not included in the
  training dataset, the item is appended to the end of the reranked list. The maximum is 500.
- `user_id`: The user for which you want the campaign to provide a personalized ranking.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"context"`: The contextual metadata to use when getting recommendations. Contextual
  metadata includes any interaction information that might be relevant when getting a user's
  recommendations, such as the user's current location or device type.
- `"filterArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a filter you created to include items or
  exclude items from recommendations for a given user. For more information, see Filtering
  Recommendations.
- `"filterValues"`: The values to use when filtering recommendations. For each placeholder
  parameter in your filter expression, provide the parameter name (in matching case) as a key
  and the filter value(s) as the corresponding value. Separate multiple values for one
  parameter with a comma.  For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include
  items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression. For
  filters with expressions that use an EXCLUDE element to exclude items, you can omit the
  filter-values.In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression
  to filter recommendations. For more information, see Filtering Recommendations.

    get_recommendations(campaign_arn)
    get_recommendations(campaign_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Returns a list of recommended items. The required input depends on the recipe type used to
create the solution backing the campaign, as follows:   RELATED_ITEMS - itemId required,
userId not used   USER_PERSONALIZATION - itemId optional, userId required    Campaigns that
are backed by a solution created using a recipe of type PERSONALIZED_RANKING use the API.

# Arguments
- `campaign_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign to use for getting
  recommendations.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"context"`: The contextual metadata to use when getting recommendations. Contextual
  metadata includes any interaction information that might be relevant when getting a user's
  recommendations, such as the user's current location or device type.
- `"filterArn"`: The ARN of the filter to apply to the returned recommendations. For more
  information, see Filtering Recommendations. When using this parameter, be sure the filter
  resource is ACTIVE.
- `"filterValues"`: The values to use when filtering recommendations. For each placeholder
  parameter in your filter expression, provide the parameter name (in matching case) as a key
  and the filter value(s) as the corresponding value. Separate multiple values for one
  parameter with a comma.  For filter expressions that use an INCLUDE element to include
  items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression. For
  filters with expressions that use an EXCLUDE element to exclude items, you can omit the
  filter-values.In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression
  to filter recommendations. For more information, see Filtering Recommendations.
- `"itemId"`: The item ID to provide recommendations for. Required for RELATED_ITEMS recipe
  type.
- `"numResults"`: The number of results to return. The default is 25. The maximum is 500.
- `"userId"`: The user ID to provide recommendations for. Required for USER_PERSONALIZATION
  recipe type.
