    create_access_point(client_token, file_system_id)
    create_access_point(client_token, file_system_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific view into an EFS
file system that applies an operating system user and group, and a file system path, to any
file system request made through the access point. The operating system user and group
override any identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is
exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the access point can only
access data in the application's own directory and any subdirectories. To learn more, see
Mounting a file system using EFS access points. This operation requires permissions for the
elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint action.

# Arguments
- `client_token`: A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon EFS uses to ensure
  idempotent creation.
- `file_system_id`: The ID of the EFS file system that the access point provides access to.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"PosixUser"`: The operating system user and group applied to all file system requests
  made using the access point.
- `"RootDirectory"`: Specifies the directory on the Amazon EFS file system that the access
  point exposes as the root directory of your file system to NFS clients using the access
  point. The clients using the access point can only access the root directory and below. If
  the RootDirectory &gt; Path specified does not exist, EFS creates it and applies the
  CreationInfo settings when a client connects to an access point. When specifying a
  RootDirectory, you must provide the Path, and the CreationInfo. Amazon EFS creates a root
  directory only if you have provided the CreationInfo: OwnUid, OwnGID, and permissions for
  the directory. If you do not provide this information, Amazon EFS does not create the root
  directory. If the root directory does not exist, attempts to mount using the access point
  will fail.
- `"Tags"`: Creates tags associated with the access point. Each tag is a key-value pair,
  each key must be unique. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources in
  the Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide.

    create_file_system(creation_token)
    create_file_system(creation_token, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request
that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same
creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by
the caller's Amazon Web Services account with the specified creation token, this operation
does the following:   Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon
EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state creating.   Returns with the description of
the created file system.   Otherwise, this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists
error with the ID of the existing file system.  For basic use cases, you can use a randomly
generated UUID for the creation token.   The idempotent operation allows you to retry a
CreateFileSystem call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when
an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was
actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your
connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had
succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the
FileSystemAlreadyExists error. For more information, see Creating a file system in the
Amazon EFS User Guide.  The CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system's lifecycle
state is still creating. You can check the file system creation status by calling the
DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things returns the file system state.
This operation accepts an optional PerformanceMode parameter that you choose for your file
system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems. File systems
using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and
operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file
operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created.
For more information, see Amazon EFS performance modes. You can set the throughput mode for
the file system using the ThroughputMode parameter. After the file system is fully created,
Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to available, at which point you can create one or more
mount targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see CreateMountTarget.
You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount
target. For more information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works.   This operation requires
permissions for the elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem action.

# Arguments
- `creation_token`: A string of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this to ensure
  idempotent creation.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AvailabilityZoneName"`: Used to create a file system that uses One Zone storage
  classes. It specifies the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which to create the file
  system. Use the format us-east-1a to specify the Availability Zone. For more information
  about One Zone storage classes, see Using EFS storage classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide.
   One Zone storage classes are not available in all Availability Zones in Amazon Web
  Services Regions where Amazon EFS is available.
- `"Backup"`: Specifies whether automatic backups are enabled on the file system that you
  are creating. Set the value to true to enable automatic backups. If you are creating a file
  system that uses One Zone storage classes, automatic backups are enabled by default. For
  more information, see Automatic backups in the Amazon EFS User Guide. Default is false.
  However, if you specify an AvailabilityZoneName, the default is true.  Backup is not
  available in all Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon EFS is available.
- `"Encrypted"`: A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When
  creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying an existing Key
  Management Service key (KMS key). If you don't specify a KMS key, then the default KMS key
  for Amazon EFS, /aws/elasticfilesystem, is used to protect the encrypted file system.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: The ID of the KMS key that you want to use to protect the encrypted file
  system. This parameter is required only if you want to use a non-default KMS key. If this
  parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for Amazon EFS is used. You can specify a
  KMS key ID using the following formats:   Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for
  example 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
  key, for example
  arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Key alias -
  A previously created display name for a key, for example alias/projectKey1.   Key alias ARN
  - An ARN for a key alias, for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1.
    If you use KmsKeyId, you must set the CreateFileSystemRequestEncrypted parameter to true.
   EFS accepts only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot use asymmetric KMS keys with Amazon EFS
  file systems.
- `"PerformanceMode"`: The performance mode of the file system. We recommend generalPurpose
  performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can
  scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of
  slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed
  after the file system has been created.  The maxIO mode is not supported on file systems
  using One Zone storage classes.
- `"ProvisionedThroughputInMibps"`: The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to
  provision for a file system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if
  ThroughputMode is set to provisioned. The upper limit for throughput is 1024 MiB/s. To
  increase this limit, contact Amazon Web Services Support. For more information, see Amazon
  EFS quotas that you can increase in the Amazon EFS User Guide.
- `"Tags"`: Use to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each tag is a
  user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by including a
  \"Key\":\"Name\",\"Value\":\"{value}\" key-value pair. Each key must be unique. For more
  information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources in the Amazon Web Services General
  Reference Guide.
- `"ThroughputMode"`: Specifies the throughput mode for the file system, either bursting or
  provisioned. If you set ThroughputMode to provisioned, you must also set a value for
  ProvisionedThroughputInMibps. After you create the file system, you can decrease your file
  system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes,
  as long as it’s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode
  change. For more information, see Specifying throughput with provisioned mode in the Amazon
  EFS User Guide.  Default is bursting.

    create_mount_target(file_system_id, subnet_id)
    create_mount_target(file_system_id, subnet_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on EC2
instances by using the mount target. You can create one mount target in each Availability
Zone in your VPC. All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a
single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an
Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not
need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system. You
can create only one mount target for an EFS file system using One Zone storage classes. You
must create that mount target in the same Availability Zone in which the file system is
located. Use the AvailabilityZoneName and AvailabiltyZoneId properties in the
DescribeFileSystems response object to get this information. Use the subnetId associated
with the file system's Availability Zone when creating the mount target. For more
information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works.  To create a mount target for a file system, the
file system's lifecycle state must be available. For more information, see
DescribeFileSystems. In the request, provide the following:   The file system ID for which
you are creating the mount target.   A subnet ID, which determines the following:   The VPC
in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target   The Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS
creates the mount target   The IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP
address of the mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the request)     After
creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a MountTargetId and
an IpAddress. You use this IP address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You
can also use the mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on
which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve the mount target's
DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see How it Works: Implementation
Overview.  Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and
there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system
already has one or more mount targets created for it, the subnet specified in the request
to add another mount target must meet the following requirements:   Must belong to the same
VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets   Must not be in the same Availability
Zone as any of the subnets of the existing mount targets   If the request satisfies the
requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:   Creates a new mount target in the specified
subnet.   Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:   If the request
provides an IpAddress, Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface.
Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon
EC2 CreateNetworkInterface call does when a request does not specify a primary private IP
address).   If the request provides SecurityGroups, this network interface is associated
with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the
subnet's VPC.   Assigns the description Mount target fsmt-id for file system fs-id  where
fsmt-id  is the mount target ID, and  fs-id  is the FileSystemId.   Sets the
requesterManaged property of the network interface to true, and the requesterId value to
EFS.   Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network
interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the NetworkInterfaceId
field in the mount target's description to the network interface ID, and the IpAddress
field to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire CreateMountTarget
operation fails.    The CreateMountTarget call returns only after creating the network
interface, but while the mount target state is still creating, you can check the mount
target creation status by calling the DescribeMountTargets operation, which among other
things returns the mount target state.  We recommend that you create a mount target in each
of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an
Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more
information, see Amazon EFS. In addition, by always using a mount target local to the
instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the Availability
Zone in which your mount target is created goes down, then you can't access your file
system through that mount target.  This operation requires permissions for the following
action on the file system:    elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget    This operation also
requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2 actions:    ec2:DescribeSubnets
ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces     ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

# Arguments
- `file_system_id`: The ID of the file system for which to create the mount target.
- `subnet_id`: The ID of the subnet to add the mount target in. For file systems that use
  One Zone storage classes, use the subnet that is associated with the file system's
  Availability Zone.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"IpAddress"`: Valid IPv4 address within the address range of the specified subnet.
- `"SecurityGroups"`: Up to five VPC security group IDs, of the form sg-xxxxxxxx. These
  must be for the same VPC as subnet specified.

    create_replication_configuration(destinations, source_file_system_id)
    create_replication_configuration(destinations, source_file_system_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a replication configuration that replicates an existing EFS file system to a new,
read-only file system. For more information, see Amazon EFS replication in the Amazon EFS
User Guide. The replication configuration specifies the following:    Source file system -
An existing EFS file system that you want replicated. The source file system cannot be a
destination file system in an existing replication configuration.    Destination file
system configuration - The configuration of the destination file system to which the source
file system will be replicated. There can only be one destination file system in a
replication configuration. The destination file system configuration consists of the
following properties:    Amazon Web Services Region - The Amazon Web Services Region in
which the destination file system is created. Amazon EFS replication is available in all
Amazon Web Services Regions that Amazon EFS is available in, except Africa (Cape Town),
Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Europe (Milan), and Middle East
(Bahrain).    Availability Zone - If you want the destination file system to use EFS One
Zone availability and durability, you must specify the Availability Zone to create the file
system in. For more information about EFS storage classes, see  Amazon EFS storage classes
in the Amazon EFS User Guide.    Encryption - All destination file systems are created with
encryption at rest enabled. You can specify the Key Management Service (KMS) key that is
used to encrypt the destination file system. If you don't specify a KMS key, your
service-managed KMS key for Amazon EFS is used.   After the file system is created, you
cannot change the KMS key.      The following properties are set by default:    Performance
mode - The destination file system's performance mode matches that of the source file
system, unless the destination file system uses EFS One Zone storage. In that case, the
General Purpose performance mode is used. The performance mode cannot be changed.
Throughput mode - The destination file system uses the Bursting Throughput mode by default.
After the file system is created, you can modify the throughput mode.   The following
properties are turned off by default:    Lifecycle management - EFS lifecycle management
and EFS Intelligent-Tiering are not enabled on the destination file system. After the
destination file system is created, you can enable EFS lifecycle management and EFS
Intelligent-Tiering.    Automatic backups - Automatic daily backups not enabled on the
destination file system. After the file system is created, you can change this setting.
For more information, see Amazon EFS replication in the Amazon EFS User Guide.

# Arguments
- `destinations`: An array of destination configuration objects. Only one destination
  configuration object is supported.
- `source_file_system_id`: Specifies the Amazon EFS file system that you want to replicate.

    delete_mount_target(mount_target_id)
    delete_mount_target(mount_target_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deletes the specified mount target. This operation forcibly breaks any mounts of the file
system by using the mount target that is being deleted, which might disrupt instances or
applications using those mounts. To avoid applications getting cut off abruptly, you might
consider unmounting any mounts of the mount target, if feasible. The operation also deletes
the associated network interface. Uncommitted writes might be lost, but breaking a mount
target using this operation does not corrupt the file system itself. The file system you
created remains. You can mount an EC2 instance in your VPC by using another mount target.
This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file system:
elasticfilesystem:DeleteMountTarget     The DeleteMountTarget call returns while the mount
target state is still deleting. You can check the mount target deletion by calling the
DescribeMountTargets operation, which returns a list of mount target descriptions for the
given file system.   The operation also requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2
action on the mount target's network interface:    ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

    put_file_system_policy(file_system_id, policy, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Applies an Amazon EFS FileSystemPolicy to an Amazon EFS file system. A file system policy
is an IAM resource-based policy and can contain multiple policy statements. A file system
always has exactly one file system policy, which can be the default policy or an explicit
policy set or updated using this API operation. EFS file system policies have a 20,000
character limit. When an explicit policy is set, it overrides the default policy. For more
information about the default file system policy, see Default EFS File System Policy.   EFS
file system policies have a 20,000 character limit.  This operation requires permissions
for the elasticfilesystem:PutFileSystemPolicy action.

# Arguments
- `file_system_id`: The ID of the EFS file system that you want to create or update the
  FileSystemPolicy for.
- `policy`: The FileSystemPolicy that you're creating. Accepts a JSON formatted policy
  definition. EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit. To find out more about
  the elements that make up a file system policy, see EFS Resource-based Policies.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck"`: (Optional) A boolean that specifies whether or not to
  bypass the FileSystemPolicy lockout safety check. The lockout safety check determines
  whether the policy in the request will lock out, or prevent, the IAM principal that is
  making the request from making future PutFileSystemPolicy requests on this file system. Set
  BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to True only when you intend to prevent the IAM principal
  that is making the request from making subsequent PutFileSystemPolicy requests on this file
  system. The default value is False.

    put_lifecycle_configuration(file_system_id, lifecycle_policies, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Use this action to manage EFS lifecycle management and intelligent tiering. A
LifecycleConfiguration consists of one or more LifecyclePolicy objects that define the
following:    EFS Lifecycle management - When Amazon EFS automatically transitions files in
a file system into the lower-cost Infrequent Access (IA) storage class. To enable EFS
Lifecycle management, set the value of TransitionToIA to one of the available options.
EFS Intelligent tiering - When Amazon EFS automatically transitions files from IA back into
the file system's primary storage class (Standard or One Zone Standard. To enable EFS
Intelligent Tiering, set the value of TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass to AFTER_1_ACCESS.
For more information, see EFS Lifecycle Management. Each Amazon EFS file system supports
one lifecycle configuration, which applies to all files in the file system. If a
LifecycleConfiguration object already exists for the specified file system, a
PutLifecycleConfiguration call modifies the existing configuration. A
PutLifecycleConfiguration call with an empty LifecyclePolicies array in the request body
deletes any existing LifecycleConfiguration and turns off lifecycle management and
intelligent tiering for the file system. In the request, specify the following:    The ID
for the file system for which you are enabling, disabling, or modifying lifecycle
management and intelligent tiering.   A LifecyclePolicies array of LifecyclePolicy objects
that define when files are moved into IA storage, and when they are moved back to Standard
storage.  Amazon EFS requires that each LifecyclePolicy object have only have a single
transition, so the LifecyclePolicies array needs to be structured with separate
LifecyclePolicy objects. See the example requests in the following section for more
information.    This operation requires permissions for the
elasticfilesystem:PutLifecycleConfiguration operation. To apply a LifecycleConfiguration
object to an encrypted file system, you need the same Key Management Service permissions as
when you created the encrypted file system.

# Arguments
- `file_system_id`: The ID of the file system for which you are creating the
  LifecycleConfiguration object (String).
- `lifecycle_policies`: An array of LifecyclePolicy objects that define the file system's
  LifecycleConfiguration object. A LifecycleConfiguration object informs EFS lifecycle
  management and EFS Intelligent-Tiering of the following:   When to move files in the file
  system from primary storage to the IA storage class.   When to move files that are in IA
  storage to primary storage.    When using the put-lifecycle-configuration CLI command or
  the PutLifecycleConfiguration API action, Amazon EFS requires that each LifecyclePolicy
  object have only a single transition. This means that in a request body, LifecyclePolicies
  must be structured as an array of LifecyclePolicy objects, one object for each transition,
  TransitionToIA, TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass. See the example requests in the following
  section for more information.
