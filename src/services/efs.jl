    create_access_point(client_token, file_system_id)
    create_access_point(client_token, file_system_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific view into an EFS
file system that applies an operating system user and group, and a file system path, to any
file system request made through the access point. The operating system user and group
override any identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is
exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the access point can only
access data in its own directory and below. To learn more, see Mounting a File System Using
EFS Access Points. This operation requires permissions for the
elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint action.

# Arguments
- `client_token`: A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon EFS uses to ensure
  idempotent creation.
- `file_system_id`: The ID of the EFS file system that the access point provides access to.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"PosixUser"`: The operating system user and group applied to all file system requests
  made using the access point.
- `"RootDirectory"`: Specifies the directory on the Amazon EFS file system that the access
  point exposes as the root directory of your file system to NFS clients using the access
  point. The clients using the access point can only access the root directory and below. If
  the RootDirectory &gt; Path specified does not exist, EFS creates it and applies the
  CreationInfo settings when a client connects to an access point. When specifying a
  RootDirectory, you need to provide the Path, and the CreationInfo is optional.
- `"Tags"`: Creates tags associated with the access point. Each tag is a key-value pair.

"""
    create_file_system(creation_token)
    create_file_system(creation_token, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request
that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same
creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by
the caller's AWS account with the specified creation token, this operation does the
following:   Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS
assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state creating.   Returns with the description of the
created file system.   Otherwise, this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists error
with the ID of the existing file system.  For basic use cases, you can use a randomly
generated UUID for the creation token.   The idempotent operation allows you to retry a
CreateFileSystem call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when
an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was
actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your
connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had
succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the
FileSystemAlreadyExists error.  The CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system's
lifecycle state is still creating. You can check the file system creation status by calling
the DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things returns the file system state.
This operation also takes an optional PerformanceMode parameter that you choose for your
file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems. File
systems using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput
and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file
operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created.
For more information, see Amazon EFS: Performance Modes. After the file system is fully
created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to available, at which point you can create
one or more mount targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see
CreateMountTarget. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by
using the mount target. For more information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works.   This
operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem action.

# Arguments
- `creation_token`: A string of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this to ensure
  idempotent creation.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Encrypted"`: A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When
  creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying
  CreateFileSystemRequestKmsKeyId for an existing AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
  customer master key (CMK). If you don't specify a CMK, then the default CMK for Amazon EFS,
  /aws/elasticfilesystem, is used to protect the encrypted file system.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: The ID of the AWS KMS CMK to be used to protect the encrypted file system.
  This parameter is only required if you want to use a nondefault CMK. If this parameter is
  not specified, the default CMK for Amazon EFS is used. This ID can be in one of the
  following formats:   Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
  1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key,
  for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
  Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example alias/projectKey1.
  Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
  arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1.   If KmsKeyId is specified, the
  CreateFileSystemRequestEncrypted parameter must be set to true.  EFS accepts only symmetric
  CMKs. You cannot use asymmetric CMKs with EFS file systems.
- `"PerformanceMode"`: The performance mode of the file system. We recommend generalPurpose
  performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can
  scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of
  slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed
  after the file system has been created.
- `"ProvisionedThroughputInMibps"`: The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to
  provision for a file system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if
  ThroughputMode is set to provisioned. The upper limit for throughput is 1024 MiB/s. You can
  get this limit increased by contacting AWS Support. For more information, see Amazon EFS
  Limits That You Can Increase in the Amazon EFS User Guide.
- `"Tags"`: A value that specifies to create one or more tags associated with the file
  system. Each tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by
  including a \"Key\":\"Name\",\"Value\":\"{value}\" key-value pair.
- `"ThroughputMode"`: The throughput mode for the file system to be created. There are two
  throughput modes to choose from for your file system: bursting and provisioned. If you set
  ThroughputMode to provisioned, you must also set a value for ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps.
  You can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change
  between the throughput modes as long as it’s been more than 24 hours since the last
  decrease or throughput mode change. For more, see Specifying Throughput with Provisioned
  Mode in the Amazon EFS User Guide.

    create_mount_target(file_system_id, subnet_id)
    create_mount_target(file_system_id, subnet_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on EC2
instances by using the mount target. You can create one mount target in each Availability
Zone in your VPC. All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a
single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an
Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not
need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system. For
more information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works.  In the request, you also specify a file
system ID for which you are creating the mount target and the file system's lifecycle state
must be available. For more information, see DescribeFileSystems. In the request, you also
provide a subnet ID, which determines the following:   VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the
mount target   Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target   IP address
range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the mount target (if you don't
specify an IP address in the request)   After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns
a response that includes, a MountTargetId and an IpAddress. You use this IP address when
mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target's DNS name
when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system by using
the mount target can resolve the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more
information, see How it Works: Implementation Overview.  Note that you can create mount
targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can be only one mount target per
Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets
created for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet
the following requirements:   Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing
mount targets   Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the
existing mount targets   If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the
following:   Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.   Also creates a new
network interface in the subnet as follows:   If the request provides an IpAddress, Amazon
EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free
address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 CreateNetworkInterface call does
when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).   If the request provides
SecurityGroups, this network interface is associated with those security groups. Otherwise,
it belongs to the default security group for the subnet's VPC.   Assigns the description
Mount target fsmt-id for file system fs-id  where  fsmt-id  is the mount target ID, and
fs-id  is the FileSystemId.   Sets the requesterManaged property of the network interface
to true, and the requesterId value to EFS.   Each Amazon EFS mount target has one
corresponding requester-managed EC2 network interface. After the network interface is
created, Amazon EFS sets the NetworkInterfaceId field in the mount target's description to
the network interface ID, and the IpAddress field to its address. If network interface
creation fails, the entire CreateMountTarget operation fails.    The CreateMountTarget call
returns only after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state is
still creating, you can check the mount target creation status by calling the
DescribeMountTargets operation, which among other things returns the mount target state.
We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are
cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target
created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see Amazon EFS. In addition, by
always using a mount target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a
partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount target is created
goes down, then you can't access your file system through that mount target.  This
operation requires permissions for the following action on the file system:
elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget    This operation also requires permissions for the
following Amazon EC2 actions:    ec2:DescribeSubnets     ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces
ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

# Arguments
- `file_system_id`: The ID of the file system for which to create the mount target.

elasticfilesystem:DescribeMountTargets action, on either the file system ID that you
specify in FileSystemId, or on the file system of the mount target that you specify in
MountTargetId.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AccessPointId"`: (Optional) The ID of the access point whose mount targets that you
  want to list. It must be included in your request if a FileSystemId or MountTargetId is not
  included in your request. Accepts either an access point ID or ARN as input.
- `"FileSystemId"`: (Optional) ID of the file system whose mount targets you want to list
  (String). It must be included in your request if an AccessPointId or MountTargetId is not
  included. Accepts either a file system ID or ARN as input.
- `"Marker"`: (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a previous
  DescribeMountTargets operation (String). If present, it specifies to continue the list from
  where the previous returning call left off.
- `"MaxItems"`: (Optional) Maximum number of mount targets to return in the response.
  Currently, this number is automatically set to 10, and other values are ignored. The
  response is paginated at 100 per page if you have more than 100 mount targets.
- `"MountTargetId"`: (Optional) ID of the mount target that you want to have described
  (String). It must be included in your request if FileSystemId is not included. Accepts
  either a mount target ID or ARN as input.

Modifies the set of security groups in effect for a mount target. When you create a mount
target, Amazon EFS also creates a new network interface. For more information, see
CreateMountTarget. This operation replaces the security groups in effect for the network
interface associated with a mount target, with the SecurityGroups provided in the request.
This operation requires that the network interface of the mount target has been created and
the lifecycle state of the mount target is not deleted.  The operation requires permissions
for the following actions:    elasticfilesystem:ModifyMountTargetSecurityGroups action on
the mount target's file system.     ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute action on the mount
target's network interface.

    put_file_system_policy(file_system_id, policy)
    put_file_system_policy(file_system_id, policy, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Applies an Amazon EFS FileSystemPolicy to an Amazon EFS file system. A file system policy
is an IAM resource-based policy and can contain multiple policy statements. A file system
always has exactly one file system policy, which can be the default policy or an explicit
policy set or updated using this API operation. When an explicit policy is set, it
overrides the default policy. For more information about the default file system policy,
see Default EFS File System Policy.  This operation requires permissions for the
elasticfilesystem:PutFileSystemPolicy action.

# Arguments
- `file_system_id`: The ID of the EFS file system that you want to create or update the
  FileSystemPolicy for.
- `policy`: The FileSystemPolicy that you're creating. Accepts a JSON formatted policy
  definition. To find out more about the elements that make up a file system policy, see EFS
  Resource-based Policies.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck"`: (Optional) A flag to indicate whether to bypass the
  FileSystemPolicy lockout safety check. The policy lockout safety check determines whether
  the policy in the request will prevent the principal making the request will be locked out
  from making future PutFileSystemPolicy requests on the file system. Set
  BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to True only when you intend to prevent the principal that
  is making the request from making a subsequent PutFileSystemPolicy request on the file
  system. The default value is False.

    put_lifecycle_configuration(file_system_id, lifecycle_policies)
    put_lifecycle_configuration(file_system_id, lifecycle_policies, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Enables lifecycle management by creating a new LifecycleConfiguration object. A
LifecycleConfiguration object defines when files in an Amazon EFS file system are
automatically transitioned to the lower-cost EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class. A
LifecycleConfiguration applies to all files in a file system. Each Amazon EFS file system
supports one lifecycle configuration, which applies to all files in the file system. If a
LifecycleConfiguration object already exists for the specified file system, a
PutLifecycleConfiguration call modifies the existing configuration. A
PutLifecycleConfiguration call with an empty LifecyclePolicies array in the request body
deletes any existing LifecycleConfiguration and disables lifecycle management. In the
request, specify the following:    The ID for the file system for which you are enabling,
disabling, or modifying lifecycle management.   A LifecyclePolicies array of
LifecyclePolicy objects that define when files are moved to the IA storage class. The array
can contain only one LifecyclePolicy item.   This operation requires permissions for the
elasticfilesystem:PutLifecycleConfiguration operation. To apply a LifecycleConfiguration
object to an encrypted file system, you need the same AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
permissions as when you created the encrypted file system.

# Arguments
- `file_system_id`: The ID of the file system for which you are creating the
  LifecycleConfiguration object (String).
- `lifecycle_policies`: An array of LifecyclePolicy objects that define the file system's
  LifecycleConfiguration object. A LifecycleConfiguration object tells lifecycle management
  when to transition files from the Standard storage class to the Infrequent Access storage
  class.
