    AbortMultipartUpload()

This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID. After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any more parts to the multipart upload or complete the multipart upload. Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an already-aborted upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about uploading a part and completing a multipart upload, see UploadMultipartPart and CompleteMultipartUpload. This operation is idempotent. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Working with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and Abort Multipart Upload in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide. 

# Required Parameters
- `accountId`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
- `uploadId`: The upload ID of the multipart upload to delete.
- `vaultName`: The name of the vault.

    AbortVaultLock()

This operation aborts the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the Locked state. If the vault lock is in the Locked state when this operation is requested, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. Aborting the vault locking process removes the vault lock policy from the specified vault.  A vault lock is put into the InProgress state by calling InitiateVaultLock. A vault lock is put into the Locked state by calling CompleteVaultLock. You can get the state of a vault lock by calling GetVaultLock. For more information about the vault locking process, see Amazon Glacier Vault Lock. For more information about vault lock policies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies.  This operation is idempotent. You can successfully invoke this operation multiple times, if the vault lock is in the InProgress state or if there is no policy associated with the vault.

# Required Parameters
- `accountId`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.

    AddTagsToVault()

This operation adds the specified tags to a vault. Each tag is composed of a key and a value. Each vault can have up to 10 tags. If your request would cause the tag limit for the vault to be exceeded, the operation throws the LimitExceededException error. If a tag already exists on the vault under a specified key, the existing key value will be overwritten. For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon S3 Glacier Resources. 

# Required Parameters

"""
    CompleteMultipartUpload()

You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob. In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums. On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue. Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an error and the operation fails. Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload) and Complete Multipart Upload in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide. 

# Required Parameters
- `accountId`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault.

If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
- `uploadId`: The upload ID of the multipart upload.
- `vaultName`: The name of the vault.

# Optional Parameters
- `x-amz-archive-size`: The total size, in bytes, of the entire archive. This value should be the sum of all the sizes of the individual parts that you uploaded.
- `x-amz-sha256-tree-hash`: The SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive. It is the tree hash of SHA256 tree hash of the individual parts. If the value you specify in the request does not match the SHA256 tree hash of the final assembled archive as computed by Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier), Glacier returns an error and the request fails.

    GetJobOutput()

This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using InitiateJob. Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault inventory. You can download all the job output or download a portion of the output by specifying a byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) returns the checksum for the portion of the data. You can compute the checksum on the client and verify that the values match to ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data. A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes the job. That a byte range. For both archive and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against the size returned in the headers from the Get Job Output response. For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size is based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you specify a range of bytes=0-1048575, you should verify your download size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected size is the size of the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon S3 Glacier The expected size is also returned in the headers from the Get Job Output response. In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data. To ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data, compute the checksum on the client, verify that the values match, and verify that the size is what you expected. A job ID does not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes the job. That is, you can download the job output within the 24 hours period after Amazon Glacier completes the job.

- `jobId`: The job ID whose data is downloaded.
- `vaultName`: The name of the vault.

# Optional Parameters
- `Range`: The range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you want to download the first 1,048,576 bytes, specify the range as bytes=0-1048575. By default, this operation downloads the entire output. If the job output is large, then you can use a range to retrieve a portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output in smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output requests. You use the following process to download the job output:   Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.   Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree hash of the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client and compare it with the checksum you received in the response to ensure you received all the expected data.   Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range.   After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to find the checksum of the entire output. Using the DescribeJob API, obtain job information of the job that provided you the output. The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in Amazon S3 Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content with no errors.

"""
    InitiateMultipartUpload()

This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see UploadMultipartPart). When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB. Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.   You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.  After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload) and Initiate Multipart Upload in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `accountId`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID. 
- `vaultName`: The name of the vault.

# Optional Parameters
- `x-amz-archive-description`: The archive description that you are uploading in parts. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2, for example 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB (4096 MB).

    InitiateVaultLock()

This operation initiates the vault locking process by doing the following:   Installing a vault lock policy on the specified vault.   Setting the lock state of vault lock to InProgress.   Returning a lock ID, which is used to complete the vault locking process.   You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can be up to 20 KB in size. For more information about vault lock policies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies.  You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the vault lock enters the InProgress state. After the 24 hour window ends, the lock ID expires, the vault automatically exits the InProgress state, and the vault lock policy is removed from the vault. You call CompleteVaultLock to complete the vault locking process by setting the state of the vault lock to Locked.  After a vault lock is in the Locked state, you cannot initiate a new vault lock for the vault. You can abort the vault locking process by calling AbortVaultLock. You can get the state of the vault lock by calling GetVaultLock. For more information about the vault locking process, Amazon Glacier Vault Lock. If this operation is called when the vault lock is in the InProgress state, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. When the vault lock is in the InProgress state you must call AbortVaultLock before you can initiate a new vault lock policy. 

# Required Parameters
- `accountId`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

"""
    ListJobs()

This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are in-progress and jobs that have recently finished. The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation time.  Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists.  The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response Marker field. If there are no more jobs to list, the Marker field is set to null. If there are more jobs to list, the Marker field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the Marker value for that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request. You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying the limit parameter in the request. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit. Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional statuscode parameter or completed parameter, or both. Using the statuscode parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match either the InProgress, Succeeded, or Failed status. Using the completed parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were completed (true) or jobs that were not completed (false). For more information about using this operation, see the documentation for the underlying REST API List Jobs. 

# Required Parameters
- `accountId`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID. 
- `vaultName`: The name of the vault.

# Optional Parameters
- `completed`: The state of the jobs to return. You can specify true or false.
- `limit`: The maximum number of jobs to be returned. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the specified limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.
- `marker`: An opaque string used for pagination. This value specifies the job at which the listing of jobs should begin. Get the marker value from a previous List Jobs response. You only need to include the marker if you are continuing the pagination of results started in a previous List Jobs request.

    ListMultipartUploads()

This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads for the specified vault. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by an InitiateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. The list returned in the List Multipart Upload response has no guaranteed order.  The List Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 multipart uploads in the response. You should always check the response for a marker at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the marker is null. To return a list of multipart uploads that begins at a specific upload, set the marker request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Multipart Upload request. You can also limit the number of uploads returned in the response by specifying the limit parameter in the request. Note the difference between this operation and listing parts (ListParts). The List Multipart Uploads operation lists all multipart uploads for a vault and does not require a multipart upload ID. The List Parts operation requires a multipart upload ID since parts are associated with a single upload. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).

After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.  You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums.  You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters.

If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.     Range does not alignThe byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.    This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload) and Upload Part  in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `accountId`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID. 
- `uploadId`: The upload ID of the multipart upload.
- `vaultName`: The name of the vault.

# Optional Parameters
- `Content-Range`: Identifies the range of bytes in the assembled archive that will be uploaded in this part. Amazon S3 Glacier uses this information to assemble the archive in the proper sequence. The format of this header follows RFC 2616. An example header is Content-Range:bytes 0-4194303/*.
- `body`: The data to upload.
- `x-amz-sha256-tree-hash`: The SHA256 tree hash of the data being uploaded.
