    abort_multipart_upload(account_id, upload_id, vault_name)
    abort_multipart_upload(account_id, upload_id, vault_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID. After the Abort
Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any more parts to the multipart upload
or complete the multipart upload. Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an
already-aborted upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about uploading
a part and completing a multipart upload, see UploadMultipartPart and
CompleteMultipartUpload. This operation is idempotent. An AWS account has full permission
to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Working
with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and Abort Multipart Upload in the Amazon Glacier
Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the
  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in
  which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used
  to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
- `upload_id`: The upload ID of the multipart upload to delete.
- `vault_name`: The name of the vault.

    abort_vault_lock(account_id, vault_name)
    abort_vault_lock(account_id, vault_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

This operation aborts the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the Locked
state. If the vault lock is in the Locked state when this operation is requested, the
operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. Aborting the vault locking process
removes the vault lock policy from the specified vault.  A vault lock is put into the
InProgress state by calling InitiateVaultLock. A vault lock is put into the Locked state by
calling CompleteVaultLock. You can get the state of a vault lock by calling GetVaultLock.
For more information about the vault locking process, see Amazon Glacier Vault Lock. For
more information about vault lock policies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault
Lock Policies.  This operation is idempotent. You can successfully invoke this operation
multiple times, if the vault lock is in the InProgress state or if there is no policy
associated with the vault.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS
  account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify

This operation adds the specified tags to a vault. Each tag is composed of a key and a
value. Each vault can have up to 10 tags. If your request would cause the tag limit for the
vault to be exceeded, the operation throws the LimitExceededException error. If a tag
already exists on the vault under a specified key, the existing key value will be
overwritten. For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon S3 Glacier Resources.

"""
    complete_multipart_upload(account_id, upload_id, vault_name)
    complete_multipart_upload(account_id, upload_id, vault_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts
have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts.
After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the
newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After
you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a
later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a
vault. For more information, see InitiateJob. In the request, you must include the computed
SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a
SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums. On the server side, Glacier also constructs the
SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive
to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The ListParts
operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes
checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.
Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the
archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an error and the operation
fails. Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful
complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the
operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you
experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error,
in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same
archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart
upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will
not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible. An
AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity
and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant
them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access
Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual information and
underlying REST API, see Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload) and Complete
Multipart Upload in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the
  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in
  which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used
  to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
- `upload_id`: The upload ID of the multipart upload.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"x-amz-archive-size"`: The total size, in bytes, of the entire archive. This value
  should be the sum of all the sizes of the individual parts that you uploaded.
- `"x-amz-sha256-tree-hash"`: The SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive. It is the tree
  hash of SHA256 tree hash of the individual parts. If the value you specify in the request
  does not match the SHA256 tree hash of the final assembled archive as computed by Amazon S3
  Glacier (Glacier), Glacier returns an error and the request fails.

This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the
InProgress state to the Locked state, which causes the vault lock policy to become
unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the InProgress state by calling InitiateVaultLock.
You can obtain the state of the vault lock by calling GetVaultLock. For more information
about the vault locking process, Amazon Glacier Vault Lock.  This operation is idempotent.
This request is always successful if the vault lock is in the Locked state and the provided
lock ID matches the lock ID originally used to lock the vault. If an invalid lock ID is

on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the
content of an archive or a vault inventory. You can download all the job output or download
a portion of the output by specifying a byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval
job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) returns the

will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes the job. That a byte range.
For both archive and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size
against the size returned in the headers from the Get Job Output response. For archive
retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you expected. If you download
a portion of the output, the expected size is based on the range of bytes you specified.
For example, if you specify a range of bytes=0-1048575, you should verify your download
size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected size is the size
of the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon S3 Glacier The expected size is also returned
in the headers from the Get Job Output response. In the case of an archive retrieval job,

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Range"`: The range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you want to
  download the first 1,048,576 bytes, specify the range as bytes=0-1048575. By default, this
  operation downloads the entire output. If the job output is large, then you can use a range
  to retrieve a portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output in
  smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job output you want to
  download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of data at a time, which is a total of
  eight Get Job Output requests. You use the following process to download the job output:
  Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte range. Verify that all
  128 MB of data was received.   Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree
  hash of the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client and compare it
  with the checksum you received in the response to ensure you received all the expected
  data.   Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output data, each time
  specifying the appropriate byte range.   After downloading all the parts of the job output,
  you have a list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to find the
  checksum of the entire output. Using the DescribeJob API, obtain job information of the job
  that provided you the output. The response includes the checksum of the entire archive
  stored in Amazon S3 Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you computed to

    initiate_multipart_upload(account_id, vault_name)
    initiate_multipart_upload(account_id, vault_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload
resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent
requests to upload parts of an archive (see UploadMultipartPart). When you initiate a
multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a
megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB),
4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the
maximum is 4 GB. Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart), except
the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For
example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload
with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.
You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because
Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.  After you
complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) removes the multipart upload
resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you
cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24
hours. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must
grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see
Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For conceptual information
and underlying REST API, see Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload) and
Initiate Multipart Upload in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

    initiate_vault_lock(account_id, vault_name)

This operation initiates the vault locking process by doing the following:   Installing a
vault lock policy on the specified vault.   Setting the lock state of vault lock to
InProgress.   Returning a lock ID, which is used to complete the vault locking process.
You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can be up to 20 KB in
size. For more information about vault lock policies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control
with Vault Lock Policies.  You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours
after the vault lock enters the InProgress state. After the 24 hour window ends, the lock
ID expires, the vault automatically exits the InProgress state, and the vault lock policy
is removed from the vault. You call CompleteVaultLock to complete the vault locking process
by setting the state of the vault lock to Locked.  After a vault lock is in the Locked
state, you cannot initiate a new vault lock for the vault. You can abort the vault locking
process by calling AbortVaultLock. You can get the state of the vault lock by calling
GetVaultLock. For more information about the vault locking process, Amazon Glacier Vault
Lock. If this operation is called when the vault lock is in the InProgress state, the
operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. When the vault lock is in the InProgress
state you must call AbortVaultLock before you can initiate a new vault lock policy.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS

This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are in-progress and jobs that
have recently finished. The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job
initiation time.  Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before
deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs
can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed
enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or
your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive
retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the
archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the
archive while the job exists.  The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should
always check the response Marker field. If there are no more jobs to list, the Marker field
is set to null. If there are more jobs to list, the Marker field is set to a non-null
value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs
that begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the Marker value for
that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request. You can set a maximum limit
for the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying the limit parameter in the
request. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the
limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit. Additionally, you can
filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional statuscode parameter or completed
parameter, or both. Using the statuscode parameter, you can specify to return only jobs
that match either the InProgress, Succeeded, or Failed status. Using the completed
parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were completed (true) or jobs that were
not completed (false). For more information about using this operation, see the
documentation for the underlying REST API List Jobs.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the

This operation configures an access policy for a vault and will overwrite an existing
policy. To configure a vault access policy, send a PUT request to the access-policy
subresource of the vault. An access policy is specific to a vault and is also called a
vault subresource. You can set one access policy per vault and the policy can be up to 20
KB in size. For more information about vault access policies, see Amazon Glacier Access
Control with Vault Access Policies.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the
  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in
  which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used
  to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
- `vault_name`: The name of the vault.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"policy"`: The vault access policy as a JSON string.

"""
    set_vault_notifications(account_id, vault_name)
    set_vault_notifications(account_id, vault_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific events happen to a
vault. By default, you don't get any notifications. To configure vault notifications, send
a PUT request to the notification-configuration subresource of the vault. The request
should include a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific events for
which you want Amazon S3 Glacier to send notifications to the topic. Amazon SNS topics must
grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish notifications to the topic. You can
configure a vault to publish a notification for the following vault events:
ArchiveRetrievalCompleted This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive
retrieval is completed (InitiateJob). The status of the completed job can be \"Succeeded\"
or \"Failed\". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from
DescribeJob.     InventoryRetrievalCompleted This event occurs when a job that was
initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed (InitiateJob). The status of the
completed job can be \"Succeeded\" or \"Failed\". The notification sent to the SNS topic is
the same output as returned from DescribeJob.    An AWS account has full permission to
perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users
don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform
specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM). For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Configuring Vault
Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier and Set Vault Notification Configuration  in the Amazon
Glacier Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the
  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in
  which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used

"""
    upload_archive(account_id, vault_name)
    upload_archive(account_id, vault_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation, and for a
successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID
in the x-amz-archive-id header of the response.  You must use the archive ID to access your
data in Amazon S3 Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID
returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive
ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You
can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred
to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can
also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more
information, see InitiateJob.  You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are
uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums.
You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII
characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get
the vault inventory. For more information, see InitiateJob. Amazon Glacier does not
interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique.
You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list.  Archives are
immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description. An
AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity
and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant
them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access
Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual information and
underlying REST API, see Uploading an Archive in Amazon Glacier and Upload Archive in the

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"body"`: The data to upload.

    upload_multipart_part(account_id, upload_id, vault_name)
    upload_multipart_part(account_id, upload_id, vault_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any order. You
can also upload them in parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.
Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:
   SHA256 tree hash does not matchTo ensure that part data is not corrupted in
transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request.
Upon receiving the part data, Amazon S3 Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these
hash values don't match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree
hash, see Computing Checksums.    Part size does not matchThe size of each part except the
last must match the size specified in the corresponding InitiateMultipartUpload request.
The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.
If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your
initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part
request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.
   Range does not alignThe byte range value in the request does not align with the part
size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part
size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to
8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6
MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.    This operation
is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most
recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data. An AWS account has full permission
to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Uploading
Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload) and Upload Part  in the Amazon Glacier Developer
Guide.

# Arguments
- `account_id`: The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the
  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in
  which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used
  to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
- `upload_id`: The upload ID of the multipart upload.
- `vault_name`: The name of the vault.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Content-Range"`: Identifies the range of bytes in the assembled archive that will be
  uploaded in this part. Amazon S3 Glacier uses this information to assemble the archive in
  the proper sequence. The format of this header follows RFC 2616. An example header is
  Content-Range:bytes 0-4194303/*.
- `"body"`: The data to upload.
- `"x-amz-sha256-tree-hash"`: The SHA256 tree hash of the data being uploaded.
