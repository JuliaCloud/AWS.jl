    CreateBackupPlan()

Backup plans are documents that contain information that AWS Backup uses to schedule tasks that create recovery points of resources. If you call CreateBackupPlan with a plan that already exists, an AlreadyExistsException is returned.

# Required Parameters
- `BackupPlan`: Specifies the body of a backup plan. Includes a BackupPlanName and one or more sets of Rules.

# Optional Parameters
- `BackupPlanTags`: To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair. The specified tags are assigned to all backups created with this plan.
- `CreatorRequestId`: Identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. If the request includes a CreatorRequestId that matches an existing backup plan, that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.

"""
    CreateBackupSelection()

Creates a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to a backup plan. Resources can be included by specifying patterns for a ListOfTags and selected Resources.  For example, consider the following patterns:    Resources: \"arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:volume/volume-id\"     ConditionKey:\"department\"   ConditionValue:\"finance\"   ConditionType:\"STRINGEQUALS\"     ConditionKey:\"importance\"   ConditionValue:\"critical\"   ConditionType:\"STRINGEQUALS\"    Using these patterns would back up all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are tagged as \"department=finance\", \"importance=critical\", in addition to an EBS volume with the specified volume Id. Resources and conditions are additive in that all resources that match the pattern are selected. This shouldn't be confused with a logical AND, where all conditions must match. The matching patterns are logically 'put together using the OR operator. In other words, all patterns that match are selected for backup.

# Required Parameters
- `BackupSelection`: Specifies the body of a request to assign a set of resources to a backup plan.
- `backupPlanId`: Uniquely identifies the backup plan to be associated with the selection of resources.

# Optional Parameters
- `CreatorRequestId`: A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice.

Starts a job to create a one-time backup of the specified resource.

# Required Parameters
- `BackupVaultName`: The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the AWS Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- `IamRoleArn`: Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access.
- `ResourceArn`: An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

# Optional Parameters
- `CompleteWindowMinutes`: A value in minutes after a backup job is successfully started before it must be completed or it will be canceled by AWS Backup. This value is optional.
- `IdempotencyToken`: A customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to StartBackupJob.
- `Lifecycle`: The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. AWS Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.  Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold. 
- `RecoveryPointTags`: To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair.
- `StartWindowMinutes`: A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is optional.

    StartCopyJob()

Starts a job to create a one-time copy of the specified resource.

# Required Parameters
- `DestinationBackupVaultArn`: An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a destination backup vault to copy to; for example, arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault.

    StartRestoreJob()

Recovers the saved resource identified by an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).  If the resource ARN is included in the request, then the last complete backup of that resource is recovered. If the ARN of a recovery point is supplied, then that recovery point is restored.

# Required Parameters
- `IamRoleArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that AWS Backup uses to create the target recovery point; for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access.
- `Metadata`: A set of metadata key-value pairs. Contains information, such as a resource name, required to restore a recovery point.  You can get configuration metadata about a resource at the time it was backed up by calling GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata. However, values in addition to those provided by GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata might be required to restore a resource. For example, you might need to provide a new resource name if the original already exists. You need to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) instance:    file-system-id: ID of the Amazon EFS file system that is backed up by AWS Backup. Returned in GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata.    Encrypted: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the file system is encrypted. If KmsKeyId is specified, Encrypted must be set to true.    KmsKeyId: Specifies the AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt the restored file system.    PerformanceMode: Specifies the throughput mode of the file system.    CreationToken: A user-supplied value that ensures the uniqueness (idempotency) of the request.    newFileSystem: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.  
- `RecoveryPointArn`: An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example, arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45.

# Optional Parameters
- `IdempotencyToken`: A customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to StartRestoreJob.
- `ResourceType`: Starts a job to restore a recovery point for one of the following resources:    DynamoDB for Amazon DynamoDB    EBS for Amazon Elastic Block Store    EC2 for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud    EFS for Amazon Elastic File System    RDS for Amazon Relational Database Service    Storage Gateway for AWS Storage Gateway
