    CreateBackupPlan()

Backup plans are documents that contain information that AWS Backup uses to schedule tasks that create recovery points of resources. If you call CreateBackupPlan with a plan that already exists, an AlreadyExistsException is returned.

# Required Parameters
- `BackupPlan`: Specifies the body of a backup plan. Includes a BackupPlanName and one or more sets of Rules.

# Optional Parameters
- `BackupPlanTags`: To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair. The specified tags are assigned to all backups created with this plan.
- `CreatorRequestId`: Identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. If the request includes a CreatorRequestId that matches an existing backup plan, that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.

"""
    CreateBackupSelection()

Creates a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to a backup plan. Resources can be included by specifying patterns for a ListOfTags and selected Resources.  For example, consider the following patterns:    Resources: \"arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:volume/volume-id\"     ConditionKey:\"department\"   ConditionValue:\"finance\"   ConditionType:\"STRINGEQUALS\"     ConditionKey:\"importance\"   ConditionValue:\"critical\"   ConditionType:\"STRINGEQUALS\"    Using these patterns would back up all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are tagged as \"department=finance\", \"importance=critical\", in addition to an EBS volume with the specified volume Id. Resources and conditions are additive in that all resources that match the pattern are selected. This shouldn't be confused with a logical AND, where all conditions must match. The matching patterns are logically 'put together using the OR operator. In other words, all patterns that match are selected for backup.

# Required Parameters
- `BackupSelection`: Specifies the body of a request to assign a set of resources to a backup plan.
- `backupPlanId`: Uniquely identifies the backup plan to be associated with the selection of resources.

# Optional Parameters
- `CreatorRequestId`: A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice.

    StartRestoreJob()

Recovers the saved resource identified by an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).  If the resource ARN is included in the request, then the last complete backup of that resource is recovered. If the ARN of a recovery point is supplied, then that recovery point is restored.

# Required Parameters
- `IamRoleArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that AWS Backup uses to create the target recovery point; for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access.

You can get configuration metadata about a resource at the time it was backed up by calling GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata. However, values in addition to those provided by GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata might be required to restore a resource. For example, you might need to provide a new resource name if the original already exists. You need to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) instance:    file-system-id: ID of the Amazon EFS file system that is backed up by AWS Backup. Returned in GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata.    Encrypted: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the file system is encrypted. If KmsKeyId is specified, Encrypted must be set to true.    KmsKeyId: Specifies the AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt the restored file system.    PerformanceMode: Specifies the throughput mode of the file system.    CreationToken: A user-supplied value that ensures the uniqueness (idempotency) of the request.    newFileSystem: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.
