    create_backup_plan(backup_plan)
    create_backup_plan(backup_plan, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a backup plan using a backup plan name and backup rules. A backup plan is a
document that contains information that Backup uses to schedule tasks that create recovery
points for resources. If you call CreateBackupPlan with a plan that already exists, you
receive an AlreadyExistsException exception.

# Arguments
- `backup_plan`: Specifies the body of a backup plan. Includes a BackupPlanName and one or
  more sets of Rules.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"BackupPlanTags"`: To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to
  the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair. The specified tags are
  assigned to all backups created with this plan.
- `"CreatorRequestId"`: Identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried
  without the risk of running the operation twice. If the request includes a CreatorRequestId
  that matches an existing backup plan, that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.

    create_backup_selection(backup_selection, backup_plan_id)
    create_backup_selection(backup_selection, backup_plan_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to a backup plan.
Resources can be included by specifying patterns for a ListOfTags and selected Resources.
For example, consider the following patterns:    Resources:
\"arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:volume/volume-id\"     ConditionKey:\"department\"
ConditionValue:\"finance\"   ConditionType:\"StringEquals\"     ConditionKey:\"importance\"
  ConditionValue:\"critical\"   ConditionType:\"StringEquals\"    Using these patterns
would back up all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are tagged as
\"department=finance\", \"importance=critical\", in addition to an EBS volume with the
specified volume ID. Resources and conditions are additive in that all resources that match
the pattern are selected. This shouldn't be confused with a logical AND, where all
conditions must match. The matching patterns are logically put together using the OR
operator. In other words, all patterns that match are selected for backup.

# Arguments
- `backup_selection`: Specifies the body of a request to assign a set of resources to a
  backup plan.
- `backup_plan_id`: Uniquely identifies the backup plan to be associated with the selection
  of resources.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"CreatorRequestId"`: A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed
  requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

Creates a logical container where backups are stored. A CreateBackupVault request includes
a name, optionally one or more resource tags, an encryption key, and a request ID.  Do not
include sensitive data, such as passport numbers, in the name of a backup vault.

# Arguments
- `backup_vault_name`: The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup
  vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the
  Amazon Web Services Region where they are created. They consist of letters, numbers, and
  hyphens.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:

    create_framework(framework_controls, framework_name)
    create_framework(framework_controls, framework_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a framework with one or more controls. A framework is a collection of controls that
you can use to evaluate your backup practices. By using pre-built customizable controls to
define your policies, you can evaluate whether your backup practices comply with your
policies. To get insights into the compliance status of your frameworks, you can set up
automatic daily reports.

# Arguments
- `framework_controls`: A list of the controls that make up the framework. Each control in
  the list has a name, input parameters, and scope.
- `framework_name`: The unique name of the framework. The name must be between 1 and 256
  characters, starting with a letter, and consisting of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9),
  and underscores (_).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"FrameworkDescription"`: An optional description of the framework with a maximum of
  1,024 characters.
- `"FrameworkTags"`: Metadata that you can assign to help organize the frameworks that you
  create. Each tag is a key-value pair.
- `"IdempotencyToken"`: A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between
  otherwise identical calls to CreateFrameworkInput. Retrying a successful request with the
  same idempotency token results in a success message with no action taken.

    start_backup_job(backup_vault_name, iam_role_arn, resource_arn)
    start_backup_job(backup_vault_name, iam_role_arn, resource_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Starts an on-demand backup job for the specified resource.

# Arguments
- `backup_vault_name`: The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup
  vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the
  Amazon Web Services Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters,
  numbers, and hyphens.
- `iam_role_arn`: Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for
  example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access.
- `resource_arn`: An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The
  format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"BackupOptions"`: Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This option is
  only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup jobs. Valid values: Set
  to \"WindowsVSS\":\"enabled\" to enable the WindowsVSS backup option and create a Windows
  VSS backup. Set to \"WindowsVSS\"\"disabled\" to create a regular backup. The WindowsVSS
  option is not enabled by default.
- `"CompleteWindowMinutes"`: A value in minutes during which a successfully started backup
  must complete, or else AWS Backup will cancel the job. This value is optional. This value
  begins counting down from when the backup was scheduled. It does not add additional time
  for StartWindowMinutes, or if the backup started later than scheduled.
- `"IdempotencyToken"`: A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between
  otherwise identical calls to StartBackupJob. Retrying a successful request with the same
  idempotency token results in a success message with no action taken.
- `"Lifecycle"`: The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold
  storage and when it expires. Backup will transition and expire backups automatically
  according to the lifecycle that you define.  Backups transitioned to cold storage must be
  stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days”
  setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The
  “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been
  transitioned to cold.  Only Amazon EFS file system backups can be transitioned to cold
  storage.
- `"RecoveryPointTags"`: To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata
  to the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair.
- `"StartWindowMinutes"`: A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will
  be canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is optional, and the default is 8
  hours.

- `iam_role_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup uses to create
  the target recovery point; for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access.
- `metadata`: A set of metadata key-value pairs. Contains information, such as a resource
  name, required to restore a recovery point.  You can get configuration metadata about a
  resource at the time it was backed up by calling GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata. However,
  values in addition to those provided by GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata might be required
  to restore a resource. For example, you might need to provide a new resource name if the
  original already exists. You need to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic
  File System (Amazon EFS) instance:    file-system-id: The ID of the Amazon EFS file system
  that is backed up by Backup. Returned in GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata.    Encrypted: A
  Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the file system is encrypted. If KmsKeyId is
  specified, Encrypted must be set to true.    KmsKeyId: Specifies the Amazon Web Services
  KMS key that is used to encrypt the restored file system. You can specify a key from
  another Amazon Web Services account provided that key it is properly shared with your
  account via Amazon Web Services KMS.    PerformanceMode: Specifies the throughput mode of
  the file system.    CreationToken: A user-supplied value that ensures the uniqueness
  (idempotency) of the request.    newFileSystem: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies
  that the recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.    ItemsToRestore: An
  array of one to five strings where each string is a file path. Use ItemsToRestore to
  restore specific files or directories rather than the entire file system. This parameter is
  optional. For example, \"itemsToRestore\":\"[\"/my.test\"]\".
- `recovery_point_arn`: An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example,
  arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45.

- `"ResourceType"`: Starts a job to restore a recovery point for one of the following
  resources:    DynamoDB for Amazon DynamoDB    EBS for Amazon Elastic Block Store    EC2 for

    update_region_settings()
    update_region_settings(params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates the current service opt-in settings for the Region. If service-opt-in is enabled
for a service, Backup tries to protect that service's resources in this Region, when the
resource is included in an on-demand backup or scheduled backup plan. Otherwise, Backup
does not try to protect that service's resources in this Region. Use the
DescribeRegionSettings API to determine the resource types that are supported.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ResourceTypeOptInPreference"`: Updates the list of services along with the opt-in
  preferences for the Region.

    update_report_plan(report_plan_name)
    update_report_plan(report_plan_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates an existing report plan identified by its ReportPlanName with the input document in
JSON format.

# Arguments
- `report_plan_name`: The unique name of the report plan. This name is between 1 and 256
  characters, starting with a letter, and consisting of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9),
  and underscores (_).

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"IdempotencyToken"`: A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between
  otherwise identical calls to UpdateReportPlanInput. Retrying a successful request with the
  same idempotency token results in a success message with no action taken.
- `"ReportDeliveryChannel"`: A structure that contains information about where to deliver
  your reports, specifically your Amazon S3 bucket name, S3 key prefix, and the formats of
  your reports.
- `"ReportPlanDescription"`: An optional description of the report plan with a maximum
  1,024 characters.
- `"ReportSetting"`: Identifies the report template for the report. Reports are built using
  a report template. The report templates are:  BACKUP_JOB_REPORT | COPY_JOB_REPORT |
  RESTORE_JOB_REPORT
