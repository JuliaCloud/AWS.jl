Creates an interconnect between an Direct Connect Partner's network and a specific Direct
Connect location. An interconnect is a connection that is capable of hosting other
connections. The Direct Connect Partner can use an interconnect to provide Direct Connect
hosted connections to customers through their own network services. Like a standard
connection, an interconnect links the partner's network to an Direct Connect location over
a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the
other to an Direct Connect router. You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link
aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new
interconnect is allocated on the same Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG.
If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is
created. For each end customer, the Direct Connect Partner provisions a connection on their
interconnect by calling AllocateHostedConnection. The end customer can then connect to
Amazon Web Services resources by creating a virtual interface on their connection, using
the VLAN assigned to them by the Direct Connect Partner.  Intended for use by Direct
Connect Partners only.

# Arguments

    create_lag(connections_bandwidth, lag_name, location, number_of_connections)
    create_lag(connections_bandwidth, lag_name, location, number_of_connections, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical
dedicated connections between the customer network and a specific Direct Connect location.
A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to
aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface. All
connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth (either 1Gbps or 10Gbps) and must
terminate at the same Direct Connect endpoint. You can have up to 10 dedicated connections
per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than Direct
Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created. You can specify an existing
physical dedicated connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards
the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical dedicated
connection, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the
same Direct Connect endpoint to which the dedicated connection terminates. Any virtual
interfaces associated with the dedicated connection are automatically disassociated and
re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change. If the account used to
create a LAG is a registered Direct Connect Partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to
host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces
cannot be directly configured.

# Arguments
- `connections_bandwidth`: The bandwidth of the individual physical dedicated connections
  bundled by the LAG. The possible values are 1Gbps and 10Gbps.
- `lag_name`: The name of the LAG.
- `location`: The location for the LAG.
- `number_of_connections`: The number of physical dedicated connections initially
  provisioned and bundled by the LAG.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"childConnectionTags"`: The tags to associate with the automtically created LAGs.
- `"connectionId"`: The ID of an existing dedicated connection to migrate to the LAG.
- `"providerName"`: The name of the service provider associated with the LAG.
- `"requestMACSec"`: Indicates whether the connection will support MAC Security (MACsec).
  All connections in the LAG must be capable of supporting MAC Security (MACsec). For

- `"tags"`: The tags to associate with the LAG.

    create_private_virtual_interface(connection_id, new_private_virtual_interface, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a private virtual interface. A virtual interface is the VLAN that transports Direct
Connect traffic. A private virtual interface can be connected to either a Direct Connect
gateway or a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW). Connecting the private virtual interface to a
Direct Connect gateway enables the possibility for connecting to multiple VPCs, including
VPCs in different Regions. Connecting the private virtual interface to a VGW only provides
access to a single VPC within the same Region. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to
9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't
updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for
all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. To check
whether your connection supports jumbo frames, call DescribeConnections. To check whether
your virtual interface supports jumbo frames, call DescribeVirtualInterfaces.

# Arguments
- `connection_id`: The ID of the connection.

Creates a transit virtual interface. A transit virtual interface should be used to access
one or more transit gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways. A transit virtual
interface enables the connection of multiple VPCs attached to a transit gateway to a Direct

Updates the attributes of the specified link aggregation group (LAG). You can update the

connections that must be operational for the LAG itself to be operational.    The LAG's
MACsec encryption mode. Amazon Web Services assigns this value to each connection which is

Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"encryptionMode"`: The LAG MAC Security (MACsec) encryption mode. Amazon Web Services
  applies the value to all connections which are part of the LAG.

Updates the specified attributes of the specified virtual private interface. Setting the
MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying
physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection
disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for
up to 30 seconds. To check whether your connection supports jumbo frames, call
DescribeConnections. To check whether your virtual q interface supports jumbo frames, call
DescribeVirtualInterfaces.

Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
