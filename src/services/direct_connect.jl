    CreateInterconnect()

Creates an interconnect between an AWS Direct Connect Partner's network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location. An interconnect is a connection that is capable of hosting other connections. The AWS Direct Connect partner can use an interconnect to provide AWS Direct Connect hosted connections to customers through their own network services. Like a standard connection, an interconnect links the partner's network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new interconnect is allocated on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is created. For each end customer, the AWS Direct Connect Partner provisions a connection on their interconnect by calling AllocateHostedConnection. The end customer can then connect to AWS resources by creating a virtual interface on their connection, using the VLAN assigned to them by the AWS Direct Connect Partner.  Intended for use by AWS Direct Connect Partners only. 

Required Parameters
{
  "bandwidth": "The port bandwidth, in Gbps. The possible values are 1 and 10.",
  "interconnectName": "The name of the interconnect.",

"""
    CreateLag()

Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical connections between the customer network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface. All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth and must terminate at the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint. You can have up to 10 connections per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than AWS Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created. You can specify an existing physical connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical connection or hosted connections, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint to which the connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change. If the AWS account used to create a LAG is a registered AWS Direct Connect Partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces cannot be directly configured.

Required Parameters
{
  "connectionsBandwidth": "The bandwidth of the individual physical connections bundled by the LAG. The possible values are 50Mbps, 100Mbps, 200Mbps, 300Mbps, 400Mbps, 500Mbps, 1Gbps, 2Gbps, 5Gbps, and 10Gbps. ",

Gets the LOA-CFA for a connection, interconnect, or link aggregation group (LAG). The Letter of Authorization - Connecting Facility Assignment (LOA-CFA) is a document that is used when establishing your cross connect to AWS at the colocation facility. For more information, see Requesting Cross Connects at AWS Direct Connect Locations in the AWS Direct Connect User Guide.

Required Parameters
{
  "connectionId": "The ID of a connection, LAG, or interconnect."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "loaContentType": "The standard media type for the LOA-CFA document. The only supported value is application/pdf.",
  "providerName": "The name of the service provider who establishes connectivity on your behalf. If you specify this parameter, the LOA-CFA lists the provider name alongside your company name as the requester of the cross connect."
}

    DescribeLocations()

Lists the AWS Direct Connect locations in the current AWS Region. These are the locations that can be selected when calling CreateConnection or CreateInterconnect.

    DescribeTags()

Describes the tags associated with the specified AWS Direct Connect resources.

    DescribeVirtualGateways()

Lists the virtual private gateways owned by the AWS account. You can create one or more AWS Direct Connect private virtual interfaces linked to a virtual private gateway.

"""
    DescribeVirtualInterfaces()

Displays all virtual interfaces for an AWS account. Virtual interfaces deleted fewer than 15 minutes before you make the request are also returned. If you specify a connection ID, only the virtual interfaces associated with the connection are returned. If you specify a virtual interface ID, then only a single virtual interface is returned. A virtual interface (VLAN) transmits the traffic between the AWS Direct Connect location and the customer network.

Optional Parameters
{
  "connectionId": "The ID of the connection.",
  "virtualInterfaceId": "The ID of the virtual interface."
}

"""
    DisassociateConnectionFromLag()

Disassociates a connection from a link aggregation group (LAG). The connection is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection (the connection is not deleted; to delete the connection, use the DeleteConnection request). If the LAG has associated virtual interfaces or hosted connections, they remain associated with the LAG. A disassociated connection owned by an AWS Direct Connect Partner is automatically converted to an interconnect. If disassociating the connection would cause the LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request fails, except when it's the last member of the LAG. If all connections are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as an empty LAG with no physical connections. 

Required Parameters
{
  "connectionId": "The ID of the connection.",
  "lagId": "The ID of the LAG."
}

"""
    TagResource()

Adds the specified tags to the specified AWS Direct Connect resource. Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. If a tag with the same key is already associated with the resource, this action updates its value.

Required Parameters
{
  "resourceArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.",
  "tags": "The tags to add."
}

    UntagResource()

Removes one or more tags from the specified AWS Direct Connect resource.

    UpdateDirectConnectGatewayAssociation()

Updates the specified attributes of the Direct Connect gateway association. Add or remove prefixes from the association.

  "associationId": "The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association.",

"""
    UpdateLag()

Updates the attributes of the specified link aggregation group (LAG). You can update the following attributes:   The name of the LAG.   The value for the minimum number of connections that must be operational for the LAG itself to be operational.    When you create a LAG, the default value for the minimum number of operational connections is zero (0). If you update this value and the number of operational connections falls below the specified value, the LAG automatically goes down to avoid over-utilization of the remaining connections. Adjust this value with care, as it could force the LAG down if it is set higher than the current number of operational connections.

Required Parameters
{
  "lagId": "The ID of the LAG."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "lagName": "The name of the LAG.",
  "minimumLinks": "The minimum number of physical connections that must be operational for the LAG itself to be operational."

"""
    UpdateVirtualInterfaceAttributes()

Updates the specified attributes of the specified virtual private interface. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. To check whether your connection supports jumbo frames, call DescribeConnections. To check whether your virtual interface supports jumbo frames, call DescribeVirtualInterfaces.

Required Parameters
{
  "virtualInterfaceId": "The ID of the virtual private interface."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "mtu": "The maximum transmission unit (MTU), in bytes. The supported values are 1500 and 9001. The default value is 1500."
