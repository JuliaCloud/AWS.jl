    cancel_job(job_id, reason)
    cancel_job(job_id, reason, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Cancels a job in an AWS Batch job queue. Jobs that are in the SUBMITTED, PENDING, or
RUNNABLE state are canceled. Jobs that have progressed to STARTING or RUNNING are not
canceled (but the API operation still succeeds, even if no job is canceled); these jobs
must be terminated with the TerminateJob operation.

# Arguments
- `job_id`: The AWS Batch job ID of the job to cancel.
- `reason`: A message to attach to the job that explains the reason for canceling it. This
  message is returned by future DescribeJobs operations on the job. This message is also
  recorded in the AWS Batch activity logs.

    create_compute_environment(compute_environment_name, service_role, type)
    create_compute_environment(compute_environment_name, service_role, type, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an AWS Batch compute environment. You can create MANAGED or UNMANAGED compute
environments. MANAGED compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate resources.
UNMANAGED compute environments can only use EC2 resources. In a managed compute
environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources
within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define
or the launch template that you specify when you create the compute environment. You can
choose either to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances, or to use Fargate and
Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum
price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a
specified percentage of the On-Demand price.  Multi-node parallel jobs are not supported on
Spot Instances.  In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute
resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For
example, you can use custom AMI. However, you need to verify that your AMI meets the Amazon
ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see container instance AMIs
in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. After you have created your
unmanaged compute environment, you can use the DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to
find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, manually launch your container
instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see Launching an Amazon ECS
container instance in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  AWS Batch
doesn't upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it's created. For example, it
doesn't update the AMIs when a newer version of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI is available.
Therefore, you're responsible for the management of the guest operating system (including
updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you
install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your AWS Batch jobs, complete these
steps:   Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.   Add the compute environment
to an existing job queue.   Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.
Delete the earlier compute environment.

# Arguments
- `compute_environment_name`: The name for your compute environment. Up to 128 letters
  (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
- `service_role`: The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch
  to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf. For more information, see AWS Batch
  service IAM role in the AWS Batch User Guide. If your specified role has a path other than
  /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role
  name with the path.  Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN
  might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service
  role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of
  this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create
  compute environments.
- `type`: The type of the compute environment: MANAGED or UNMANAGED. For more information,
  see Compute Environments in the AWS Batch User Guide.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"computeResources"`: Details about the compute resources managed by the compute
  environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more
  information, see Compute Environments in the AWS Batch User Guide.
- `"state"`: The state of the compute environment. If the state is ENABLED, then the
  compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on
  queues. If the state is ENABLED, then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs
  from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the
  compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically,
  based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the AWS Batch scheduler
  doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state
  continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don't
  scale out. However, they scale in to minvCpus value after instances become idle.
- `"tags"`: The tags that you apply to the compute environment to help you categorize and
  organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more
  information, see Tagging AWS Resources in AWS General Reference. These tags can be updated
  or removed using the TagResource and UntagResource API operations. These tags don't
  propagate to the underlying compute resources.

"""
    create_job_queue(compute_environment_order, job_queue_name, priority)
    create_job_queue(compute_environment_order, job_queue_name, priority, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an AWS Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate one or more
compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference for the compute
environments. You also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order in which
the AWS Batch scheduler places jobs onto its associated compute environments. For example,
if a compute environment is associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a
higher priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.

# Arguments
- `compute_environment_order`: The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and
  their order relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to determine
  which compute environment should run a specific job. Compute environments must be in the
  VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to three
  compute environments with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2
  (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments
  can't be mixed.  All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share
  the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture
  types in a single job queue.
- `job_queue_name`: The name of the job queue. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase),
  numbers, and underscores are allowed.
- `priority`: The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher
  integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same
  compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue
  with a priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority
  value of 1. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate
  (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments cannot be mixed.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"state"`: The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is ENABLED, it is able to
  accept jobs. If the job queue state is DISABLED, new jobs can't be added to the queue, but
  jobs already in the queue can finish.
- `"tags"`: The tags that you apply to the job queue to help you categorize and organize
  your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see
  Tagging your AWS Batch resources in AWS Batch User Guide.

    delete_compute_environment(compute_environment)
    delete_compute_environment(compute_environment, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Deletes an AWS Batch compute environment. Before you can delete a compute environment, you
must set its state to DISABLED with the UpdateComputeEnvironment API operation and
disassociate it from any job queues with the UpdateJobQueue API operation. Compute
environments that use AWS Fargate resources must terminate all active jobs on that compute
environment before deleting the compute environment. If this isn't done, the compute
environment will end up in an invalid state.

override parameters defined in the job definition.  Jobs run on Fargate resources don't run
for more than 14 days. After 14 days, the Fargate resources might no longer be available
and the job is terminated.

# Arguments
- `job_definition`: The job definition used by this job. This value can be one of name,
  name:revision, or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the job definition. If name is

- `job_queue`: The job queue into which the job is submitted. You can specify either the
  name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the queue.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"arrayProperties"`: The array properties for the submitted job, such as the size of the
  array. The array size can be between 2 and 10,000. If you specify array properties for a
  job, it becomes an array job. For more information, see Array Jobs in the AWS Batch User
  Guide.
- `"containerOverrides"`: A list of container overrides in JSON format that specify the
  name of a container in the specified job definition and the overrides it should receive.
  You can override the default command for a container (that's specified in the job
  definition or the Docker image) with a command override. You can also override existing
  environment variables (that are specified in the job definition or Docker image) on a
  container or add new environment variables to it with an environment override.
- `"dependsOn"`: A list of dependencies for the job. A job can depend upon a maximum of 20
  jobs. You can specify a SEQUENTIAL type dependency without specifying a job ID for array
  jobs so that each child array job completes sequentially, starting at index 0. You can also
  specify an N_TO_N type dependency with a job ID for array jobs. In that case, each index
  child of this job must wait for the corresponding index child of each dependency to
  complete before it can begin.
- `"nodeOverrides"`: A list of node overrides in JSON format that specify the node range to
  target and the container overrides for that node range.  This parameter isn't applicable to
  jobs running on Fargate resources; use containerOverrides instead.
- `"parameters"`: Additional parameters passed to the job that replace parameter
  substitution placeholders that are set in the job definition. Parameters are specified as a
  key and value pair mapping. Parameters in a SubmitJob request override any corresponding
  parameter defaults from the job definition.
- `"propagateTags"`: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition
  to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated.
  Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name,
  job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags
  from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the FAILED state. When
  specified, this overrides the tag propagation setting in the job definition.
- `"retryStrategy"`: The retry strategy to use for failed jobs from this SubmitJob
  operation. When a retry strategy is specified here, it overrides the retry strategy defined
  in the job definition.
- `"tags"`: The tags that you apply to the job request to help you categorize and organize
  your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see
  Tagging AWS Resources in AWS General Reference.
- `"timeout"`: The timeout configuration for this SubmitJob operation. You can specify a
  timeout duration after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they haven't finished. If a
  job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried. The minimum value for the timeout is
  60 seconds. This configuration overrides any timeout configuration specified in the job
  definition. For array jobs, child jobs have the same timeout configuration as the parent
  job. For more information, see Job Timeouts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service

    tag_resource(resource_arn, tags)
    tag_resource(resource_arn, tags, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Associates the specified tags to a resource with the specified resourceArn. If existing
tags on a resource aren't specified in the request parameters, they aren't changed. When a
resource is deleted, the tags associated with that resource are deleted as well. AWS Batch
resources that support tags are compute environments, jobs, job definitions, and job
queues. ARNs for child jobs of array and multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs are not supported.

# Arguments
- `resource_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that tags are added to.
  AWS Batch resources that support tags are compute environments, jobs, job definitions, and
  job queues. ARNs for child jobs of array and multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs are not
  supported.
- `tags`: The tags that you apply to the resource to help you categorize and organize your
  resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see
  Tagging AWS Resources in AWS General Reference.

Terminates a job in a job queue. Jobs that are in the STARTING or RUNNING state are
terminated, which causes them to transition to FAILED. Jobs that have not progressed to the
STARTING state are cancelled.

# Arguments
- `job_id`: The AWS Batch job ID of the job to terminate.
- `reason`: A message to attach to the job that explains the reason for canceling it. This
  message is returned by future DescribeJobs operations on the job. This message is also
  recorded in the AWS Batch activity logs.

    update_compute_environment(compute_environment)
    update_compute_environment(compute_environment, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates an AWS Batch compute environment.

# Arguments
- `compute_environment`: The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute
  environment to update.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"computeResources"`: Details of the compute resources managed by the compute
  environment. Required for a managed compute environment. For more information, see Compute
  Environments in the AWS Batch User Guide.
- `"serviceRole"`: The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS
  Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf. For more information, see AWS
  Batch service IAM role in the AWS Batch User Guide. If your specified role has a path other
  than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the
  role name with the path.  Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN
  might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service
  role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN does not use the service-role path prefix. Because of
  this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create
  compute environments.
- `"state"`: The state of the compute environment. Compute environments in the ENABLED
  state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out automatically based on the workload
  demand of its associated queues. If the state is ENABLED, then the AWS Batch scheduler can
  attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the
  environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or
  in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the AWS
  Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or
  RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED
  state don't scale out. However, they scale in to minvCpus value after instances become idle.

"""
    update_job_queue(job_queue)
    update_job_queue(job_queue, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates a job queue.

# Arguments
- `job_queue`: The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"computeEnvironmentOrder"`: Details the set of compute environments mapped to a job
  queue and their order relative to each other. This is one of the parameters used by the job
  scheduler to determine which compute environment should run a given job. Compute
  environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. All
  of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate (FARGATE or
  FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.  All compute
  environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS
  Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.
- `"priority"`: The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a
  higher integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with
  the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a
  job queue with a priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with
  a priority value of 1. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or
  Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments cannot be mixed.
- `"state"`: Describes the queue's ability to accept new jobs. If the job queue state is
  ENABLED, it is able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is DISABLED, new jobs cannot be
  added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.
