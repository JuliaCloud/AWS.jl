    ListTagsForResource()

Lists the tags that are assigned to an Amazon Cognito identity pool. A tag is a label that you can apply to identity pools to categorize and manage them in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. You can use this action up to 10 times per second, per account.

Required Parameters
{
  "ResourceArn": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the identity pool that the tags are assigned to."
}

"""
    MergeDeveloperIdentities()

Merges two users having different IdentityIds, existing in the same identity pool, and identified by the same developer provider. You can use this action to request that discrete users be merged and identified as a single user in the Cognito environment. Cognito associates the given source user (SourceUserIdentifier) with the IdentityId of the DestinationUserIdentifier. Only developer-authenticated users can be merged. If the users to be merged are associated with the same public provider, but as two different users, an exception will be thrown. The number of linked logins is limited to 20. So, the number of linked logins for the source user, SourceUserIdentifier, and the destination user, DestinationUserIdentifier, together should not be larger than 20. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown. You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

Required Parameters
{
  "SourceUserIdentifier": "User identifier for the source user. The value should be a DeveloperUserIdentifier.",
  "IdentityPoolId": "An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.",
  "DeveloperProviderName": "The \"domain\" by which Cognito will refer to your users. This is a (pseudo) domain name that you provide while creating an identity pool. This name acts as a placeholder that allows your backend and the Cognito service to communicate about the developer provider. For the DeveloperProviderName, you can use letters as well as period (.), underscore (_), and dash (-).",
  "DestinationUserIdentifier": "User identifier for the destination user. The value should be a DeveloperUserIdentifier."

"""
    GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity()

Registers (or retrieves) a Cognito IdentityId and an OpenID Connect token for a user authenticated by your backend authentication process. Supplying multiple logins will create an implicit linked account. You can only specify one developer provider as part of the Logins map, which is linked to the identity pool. The developer provider is the "domain" by which Cognito will refer to your users. You can use GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity to create a new identity and to link new logins (that is, user credentials issued by a public provider or developer provider) to an existing identity. When you want to create a new identity, the IdentityId should be null. When you want to associate a new login with an existing authenticated/unauthenticated identity, you can do so by providing the existing IdentityId. This API will create the identity in the specified IdentityPoolId. You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

Required Parameters
{
  "IdentityPoolId": "An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.",
  "Logins": "A set of optional name-value pairs that map provider names to provider tokens. Each name-value pair represents a user from a public provider or developer provider. If the user is from a developer provider, the name-value pair will follow the syntax \"developer_provider_name\": \"developer_user_identifier\". The developer provider is the \"domain\" by which Cognito will refer to your users; you provided this domain while creating/updating the identity pool. The developer user identifier is an identifier from your backend that uniquely identifies a user. When you create an identity pool, you can specify the supported logins."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "IdentityId": "A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.",
  "TokenDuration": "The expiration time of the token, in seconds. You can specify a custom expiration time for the token so that you can cache it. If you don't provide an expiration time, the token is valid for 15 minutes. You can exchange the token with Amazon STS for temporary AWS credentials, which are valid for a maximum of one hour. The maximum token duration you can set is 24 hours. You should take care in setting the expiration time for a token, as there are significant security implications: an attacker could use a leaked token to access your AWS resources for the token's duration.  Please provide for a small grace period, usually no more than 5 minutes, to account for clock skew. "

    UnlinkDeveloperIdentity()

Unlinks a DeveloperUserIdentifier from an existing identity. Unlinked developer users will be considered new identities next time they are seen. If, for a given Cognito identity, you remove all federated identities as well as the developer user identifier, the Cognito identity becomes inaccessible. You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

Required Parameters
{
  "IdentityPoolId": "An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.",
  "DeveloperUserIdentifier": "A unique ID used by your backend authentication process to identify a user.",

"""
    LookupDeveloperIdentity()

Retrieves the IdentityID associated with a DeveloperUserIdentifier or the list of DeveloperUserIdentifier values associated with an IdentityId for an existing identity. Either IdentityID or DeveloperUserIdentifier must not be null. If you supply only one of these values, the other value will be searched in the database and returned as a part of the response. If you supply both, DeveloperUserIdentifier will be matched against IdentityID. If the values are verified against the database, the response returns both values and is the same as the request. Otherwise a ResourceConflictException is thrown.  LookupDeveloperIdentity is intended for low-throughput control plane operations: for example, to enable customer service to locate an identity ID by username. If you are using it for higher-volume operations such as user authentication, your requests are likely to be throttled. GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity is a better option for higher-volume operations for user authentication. You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

Required Parameters
{
  "IdentityPoolId": "An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "MaxResults": "The maximum number of identities to return.",
  "NextToken": "A pagination token. The first call you make will have NextToken set to null. After that the service will return NextToken values as needed. For example, let's say you make a request with MaxResults set to 10, and there are 20 matches in the database. The service will return a pagination token as a part of the response. This token can be used to call the API again and get results starting from the 11th match.",

    GetOpenIdToken()

Gets an OpenID token, using a known Cognito ID. This known Cognito ID is returned by GetId. You can optionally add additional logins for the identity.

Optional Parameters

"""
    TagResource()

Assigns a set of tags to an Amazon Cognito identity pool. A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage identity pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a general category for more specific values. For example, if you have two versions of an identity pool, one for testing and another for production, you might assign an Environment tag key to both identity pools. The value of this key might be Test for one identity pool and Production for the other. Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can track the costs associated with your identity pools. In an IAM policy, you can constrain permissions for identity pools based on specific tags or tag values. You can use this action up to 5 times per second, per account. An identity pool can have as many as 50 tags.
