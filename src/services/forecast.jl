    create_auto_predictor(predictor_name)
    create_auto_predictor(predictor_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor. Amazon Forecast creates predictors with
AutoPredictor, which involves applying the optimal combination of algorithms to each time
series in your datasets. You can use CreateAutoPredictor to create new predictors or
upgrade/retrain existing predictors.  Creating new predictors  The following parameters are
required when creating a new predictor:    PredictorName - A unique name for the predictor.
   DatasetGroupArn - The ARN of the dataset group used to train the predictor.
ForecastFrequency - The granularity of your forecasts (hourly, daily, weekly, etc).
ForecastHorizon - The number of time-steps that the model predicts. The forecast horizon is
also called the prediction length.   When creating a new predictor, do not specify a value
for ReferencePredictorArn.  Upgrading and retraining predictors  The following parameters
are required when retraining or upgrading a predictor:    PredictorName - A unique name for
the predictor.    ReferencePredictorArn - The ARN of the predictor to retrain or upgrade.
When upgrading or retraining a predictor, only specify values for the ReferencePredictorArn
and PredictorName.

# Arguments
- `predictor_name`: A unique name for the predictor

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DataConfig"`: The data configuration for your dataset group and any additional datasets.
- `"EncryptionConfig"`:
- `"ExplainPredictor"`: Create an Explainability resource for the predictor.
- `"ForecastDimensions"`: An array of dimension (field) names that specify how to group the
  generated forecast. For example, if you are generating forecasts for item sales across all
  your stores, and your dataset contains a store_id field, you would specify store_id as a
  dimension to group sales forecasts for each store.
- `"ForecastFrequency"`: The frequency of predictions in a forecast. Valid intervals are Y
  (Year), M (Month), W (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), 30min (30 minutes), 15min (15 minutes),
  10min (10 minutes), 5min (5 minutes), and 1min (1 minute). For example, \"Y\" indicates
  every year and \"5min\" indicates every five minutes. The frequency must be greater than or
  equal to the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency. When a RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset is
  provided, the frequency must be equal to the RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency.
- `"ForecastHorizon"`: The number of time-steps that the model predicts. The forecast
  horizon is also called the prediction length. The maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of
  500 time-steps or 1/4 of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length. If you are retraining an
  existing AutoPredictor, then the maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps
  or 1/3 of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length. If you are upgrading to an AutoPredictor
  or retraining an existing AutoPredictor, you cannot update the forecast horizon parameter.
  You can meet this requirement by providing longer time-series in the dataset.
- `"ForecastTypes"`: The forecast types used to train a predictor. You can specify up to
  five forecast types. Forecast types can be quantiles from 0.01 to 0.99, by increments of
  0.01 or higher. You can also specify the mean forecast with mean.
- `"MonitorConfig"`: The configuration details for predictor monitoring. Provide a name for
  the monitor resource to enable predictor monitoring. Predictor monitoring allows you to see
  how your predictor's performance changes over time. For more information, see Predictor
  Monitoring.
- `"OptimizationMetric"`: The accuracy metric used to optimize the predictor.
- `"ReferencePredictorArn"`: The ARN of the predictor to retrain or upgrade. This parameter
  is only used when retraining or upgrading a predictor. When creating a new predictor, do
  not specify a value for this parameter. When upgrading or retraining a predictor, only
  specify values for the ReferencePredictorArn and PredictorName. The value for PredictorName
  must be a unique predictor name.
- `"Tags"`: Optional metadata to help you categorize and organize your predictors. Each tag
  consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys and values are
  case sensitive. The following restrictions apply to tags:   For each resource, each tag key
  must be unique and each tag key must have one value.   Maximum number of tags per resource:
  50.   Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Maximum value length: 256
  Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces
  representable in UTF-8, and + - = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used across other
  services and resources, the character restrictions of those services also apply.    Key
  prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of aws: or AWS:. Values can have
  this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers
  it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key
  prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit. You cannot edit or delete
  tag keys with this prefix.
- `"TimeAlignmentBoundary"`: The time boundary Forecast uses to align and aggregate any
  data that doesn't align with your forecast frequency. Provide the unit of time and the time
  boundary as a key value pair. For more information on specifying a time boundary, see
  Specifying a Time Boundary. If you don't provide a time boundary, Forecast uses a set of
  Default Time Boundaries.

    create_dataset(dataset_name, dataset_type, domain, schema)
    create_dataset(dataset_name, dataset_type, domain, schema, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates an Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset that you provide
helps Forecast understand how to consume the data for model training. This includes the
following:     DataFrequency  - How frequently your historical time-series data is
collected.     Domain  and  DatasetType  - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain
and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and
types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon
Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.     Schema  - A
schema specifies the fields in the dataset, including the field name and data type.   After
creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add the dataset to a dataset
group. You use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see Importing
datasets. To get a list of all your datasets, use the ListDatasets operation. For example
Forecast datasets, see the Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub repository.  The Status of a
dataset must be ACTIVE before you can import training data. Use the DescribeDataset
operation to get the status.

# Arguments
- `dataset_name`: A name for the dataset.
- `dataset_type`: The dataset type. Valid values depend on the chosen Domain.
- `domain`: The domain associated with the dataset. When you add a dataset to a dataset
  group, this value and the value specified for the Domain parameter of the
  CreateDatasetGroup operation must match. The Domain and DatasetType that you choose
  determine the fields that must be present in the training data that you import to the
  dataset. For example, if you choose the RETAIL domain and TARGET_TIME_SERIES as the
  DatasetType, Amazon Forecast requires item_id, timestamp, and demand fields to be present
  in your data. For more information, see Importing datasets.
- `schema`: The schema for the dataset. The schema attributes and their order must match
  the fields in your data. The dataset Domain and DatasetType that you choose determine the
  minimum required fields in your training data. For information about the required fields
  for a specific dataset domain and type, see Dataset Domains and Dataset Types.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DataFrequency"`: The frequency of data collection. This parameter is required for
  RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets. Valid intervals are Y (Year), M (Month), W (Week), D (Day), H
  (Hour), 30min (30 minutes), 15min (15 minutes), 10min (10 minutes), 5min (5 minutes), and
  1min (1 minute). For example, \"D\" indicates every day and \"15min\" indicates every 15
  minutes.
- `"EncryptionConfig"`: An AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key and the AWS Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the key.
- `"Tags"`: The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset to help you categorize and
  organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
  The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
    For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
    Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Maximum value length - 256
  Unicode characters in UTF-8.   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
  resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
  Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and
  the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do
  not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as
  it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can
  have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast
  considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only
  the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.

    create_dataset_group(dataset_group_name, domain)
    create_dataset_group(dataset_group_name, domain, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a dataset group, which holds a collection of related datasets. You can add datasets
to the dataset group when you create the dataset group, or later by using the
UpdateDatasetGroup operation. After creating a dataset group and adding datasets, you use
the dataset group when you create a predictor. For more information, see Dataset groups. To
get a list of all your datasets groups, use the ListDatasetGroups operation.  The Status of
a dataset group must be ACTIVE before you can use the dataset group to create a predictor.
To get the status, use the DescribeDatasetGroup operation.

# Arguments
- `dataset_group_name`: A name for the dataset group.
- `domain`: The domain associated with the dataset group. When you add a dataset to a
  dataset group, this value and the value specified for the Domain parameter of the
  CreateDataset operation must match. The Domain and DatasetType that you choose determine
  the fields that must be present in training data that you import to a dataset. For example,
  if you choose the RETAIL domain and TARGET_TIME_SERIES as the DatasetType, Amazon Forecast
  requires that item_id, timestamp, and demand fields are present in your data. For more
  information, see Dataset groups.

# Optional Parameters

    create_dataset_import_job(data_source, dataset_arn, dataset_import_job_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Imports your training data to an Amazon Forecast dataset. You provide the location of your
training data in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and the Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that you want to import the data to. You must specify a
DataSource object that includes an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data, as Amazon Forecast makes a copy of your data
and processes it in an internal AWS system. For more information, see Set up permissions.
The training data must be in CSV or Parquet format. The delimiter must be a comma (,). You
can specify the path to a specific file, the S3 bucket, or to a folder in the S3 bucket.
For the latter two cases, Amazon Forecast imports all files up to the limit of 10,000
files. Because dataset imports are not aggregated, your most recent dataset import is the
one that is used when training a predictor or generating a forecast. Make sure that your
most recent dataset import contains all of the data you want to model off of, and not just
the new data collected since the previous import. To get a list of all your dataset import
jobs, filtered by specified criteria, use the ListDatasetImportJobs operation.

# Arguments
- `data_source`: The location of the training data to import and an AWS Identity and Access
  Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data. The training data
  must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. If encryption is used, DataSource must include an
  AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key and the IAM role must allow Amazon Forecast permission
  to access the key. The KMS key and IAM role must match those specified in the
  EncryptionConfig parameter of the CreateDataset operation.
- `dataset_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Forecast dataset that you
  want to import data to.
- `dataset_import_job_name`: The name for the dataset import job. We recommend including
  the current timestamp in the name, for example, 20190721DatasetImport. This can help you
  avoid getting a ResourceAlreadyExistsException exception.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Format"`: The format of the imported data, CSV or PARQUET. The default value is CSV.
- `"GeolocationFormat"`: The format of the geolocation attribute. The geolocation attribute
  can be formatted in one of two ways:    LAT_LONG - the latitude and longitude in decimal
  format (Example: 47.61_-122.33).    CC_POSTALCODE (US Only) - the country code (US),
  followed by the 5-digit ZIP code (Example: US_98121).
- `"Tags"`: The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset import job to help you
  categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
  which you define. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags
  per resource - 50.   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
  have only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Maximum
  value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   If your tagging schema is used across
  multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces
  representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and

  but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against
  the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags
  per resource limit.
- `"TimeZone"`: A single time zone for every item in your dataset. This option is ideal for
  datasets with all timestamps within a single time zone, or if all timestamps are normalized
  to a single time zone.  Refer to the Joda-Time API for a complete list of valid time zone
  names.
- `"TimestampFormat"`: The format of timestamps in the dataset. The format that you specify
  depends on the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created. The following formats
  are supported   \"yyyy-MM-dd\" For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D
  \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\" For the following data frequencies: H, 30min, 15min, and 1min; and
  optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D   If the format isn't specified, Amazon Forecast expects
  the format to be \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\".
- `"UseGeolocationForTimeZone"`: Automatically derive time zone information from the
  geolocation attribute. This option is ideal for datasets that contain timestamps in
  multiple time zones and those timestamps are expressed in local time.

 Explainability is only available for Forecasts and Predictors generated from an
AutoPredictor (CreateAutoPredictor)  Creates an Amazon Forecast Explainability.
Explainability helps you better understand how the attributes in your datasets impact
forecast. Amazon Forecast uses a metric called Impact scores to quantify the relative
impact of each attribute and determine whether they increase or decrease forecast values.
To enable Forecast Explainability, your predictor must include at least one of the
following: related time series, item metadata, or additional datasets like Holidays and the
Weather Index. CreateExplainability accepts either a Predictor ARN or Forecast ARN. To
receive aggregated Impact scores for all time series and time points in your datasets,
provide a Predictor ARN. To receive Impact scores for specific time series and time points,
provide a Forecast ARN.  CreateExplainability with a Predictor ARN   You can only have one
Explainability resource per predictor. If you already enabled ExplainPredictor in
CreateAutoPredictor, that predictor already has an Explainability resource.  The following
parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN:    ExplainabilityName - A unique
name for the Explainability.    ResourceArn - The Arn of the predictor.
TimePointGranularity - Must be set to “ALL”.    TimeSeriesGranularity - Must be set to
“ALL”.   Do not specify a value for the following parameters:    DataSource - Only
valid when TimeSeriesGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.    Schema - Only valid when
TimeSeriesGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.    StartDateTime - Only valid when
TimePointGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.    EndDateTime - Only valid when
TimePointGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.    CreateExplainability with a Forecast ARN   You
can specify a maximum of 50 time series and 500 time points.  The following parameters are
required when providing a Predictor ARN:    ExplainabilityName - A unique name for the
Explainability.    ResourceArn - The Arn of the forecast.    TimePointGranularity - Either
“ALL” or “SPECIFIC”.    TimeSeriesGranularity - Either “ALL” or “SPECIFIC”.
  If you set TimeSeriesGranularity to “SPECIFIC”, you must also provide the following:
  DataSource - The S3 location of the CSV file specifying your time series.    Schema - The
Schema defines the attributes and attribute types listed in the Data Source.   If you set
TimePointGranularity to “SPECIFIC”, you must also provide the following:
StartDateTime - The first timestamp in the range of time points.    EndDateTime - The last
timestamp in the range of time points.

# Arguments

    create_forecast(forecast_name, predictor_arn)
    create_forecast(forecast_name, predictor_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a forecast for each item in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset that was used to train
the predictor. This is known as inference. To retrieve the forecast for a single item at
low latency, use the operation. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple
Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the CreateForecastExportJob operation. The range of
the forecast is determined by the ForecastHorizon value, which you specify in the
CreatePredictor request. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range
within the forecast. To get a list of all your forecasts, use the ListForecasts operation.
The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as the dataset that
was used to create the predictor.  For more information, see howitworks-forecast.  The
Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you can query or export the forecast. Use the
DescribeForecast operation to get the status.  By default, a forecast includes predictions
for every item (item_id) in the dataset group that was used to train the predictor.
However, you can use the TimeSeriesSelector object to generate a forecast on a subset of
time series. Forecast creation is skipped for any time series that you specify that are not
in the input dataset. The forecast export file will not contain these time series or their
forecasted values.

# Arguments
- `forecast_name`: A name for the forecast.
- `predictor_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor to use to generate the
  forecast.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"ForecastTypes"`: The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts are generated. You can
  currently specify up to 5 quantiles per forecast. Accepted values include 0.01 to 0.99
  (increments of .01 only) and mean. The mean forecast is different from the median (0.50)
  when the distribution is not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial).  The
  default quantiles are the quantiles you specified during predictor creation. If you didn't
  specify quantiles, the default values are [\"0.1\", \"0.5\", \"0.9\"].
- `"Tags"`: The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast to help you categorize and
  organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
  The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
    For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
    Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Maximum value length - 256
  Unicode characters in UTF-8.   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
  resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
  Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and
  the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do
  not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as

    create_predictor(featurization_config, forecast_horizon, input_data_config, predictor_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

  This operation creates a legacy predictor that does not include all the predictor
functionalities provided by Amazon Forecast. To create a predictor that is compatible with
all aspects of Forecast, use CreateAutoPredictor.  Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor. In
the request, provide a dataset group and either specify an algorithm or let Amazon Forecast
choose an algorithm for you using AutoML. If you specify an algorithm, you also can
override algorithm-specific hyperparameters. Amazon Forecast uses the algorithm to train a
predictor using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. You can
then generate a forecast using the CreateForecast operation.  To see the evaluation
metrics, use the GetAccuracyMetrics operation.  You can specify a featurization
configuration to fill and aggregate the data fields in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset to
improve model training. For more information, see FeaturizationConfig. For
RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets, CreatePredictor verifies that the DataFrequency specified
when the dataset was created matches the ForecastFrequency. TARGET_TIME_SERIES datasets
don't have this restriction. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp
format. For more information, see howitworks-datasets-groups. By default, predictors are
trained and evaluated at the 0.1 (P10), 0.5 (P50), and 0.9 (P90) quantiles. You can choose
custom forecast types to train and evaluate your predictor by setting the ForecastTypes.
AutoML  If you want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the one that
minimizes the objective function, set PerformAutoML to true. The objective function is
defined as the mean of the weighted losses over the forecast types. By default, these are
the p10, p50, and p90 quantile losses. For more information, see EvaluationResult. When
AutoML is enabled, the following properties are disallowed:    AlgorithmArn     HPOConfig
  PerformHPO     TrainingParameters    To get a list of all of your predictors, use the
ListPredictors operation.  Before you can use the predictor to create a forecast, the
Status of the predictor must be ACTIVE, signifying that training has completed. To get the
status, use the DescribePredictor operation.

# Arguments
- `featurization_config`: The featurization configuration.
- `forecast_horizon`: Specifies the number of time-steps that the model is trained to
  predict. The forecast horizon is also called the prediction length. For example, if you
  configure a dataset for daily data collection (using the DataFrequency parameter of the
  CreateDataset operation) and set the forecast horizon to 10, the model returns predictions
  for 10 days. The maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/3 of the
  TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length.
- `input_data_config`: Describes the dataset group that contains the data to use to train
  the predictor.
- `predictor_name`: A name for the predictor.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AlgorithmArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the algorithm to use for model
  training. Required if PerformAutoML is not set to true.  Supported algorithms:
  arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/ARIMA     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/CNN-QR
  arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/Deep_AR_Plus     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/ETS
  arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/NPTS     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/Prophet
- `"AutoMLOverrideStrategy"`:   The LatencyOptimized AutoML override strategy is only
  available in private beta. Contact AWS Support or your account manager to learn more about
  access privileges.   Used to overide the default AutoML strategy, which is to optimize
  predictor accuracy. To apply an AutoML strategy that minimizes training time, use
  LatencyOptimized. This parameter is only valid for predictors trained using AutoML.
- `"EncryptionConfig"`: An AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key and the AWS Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the key.
- `"EvaluationParameters"`: Used to override the default evaluation parameters of the
  specified algorithm. Amazon Forecast evaluates a predictor by splitting a dataset into
  training data and testing data. The evaluation parameters define how to perform the split
  and the number of iterations.
- `"ForecastTypes"`: Specifies the forecast types used to train a predictor. You can
  specify up to five forecast types. Forecast types can be quantiles from 0.01 to 0.99, by
  increments of 0.01 or higher. You can also specify the mean forecast with mean.  The
  default value is [\"0.10\", \"0.50\", \"0.9\"].
- `"HPOConfig"`: Provides hyperparameter override values for the algorithm. If you don't
  provide this parameter, Amazon Forecast uses default values. The individual algorithms
  specify which hyperparameters support hyperparameter optimization (HPO). For more
  information, see aws-forecast-choosing-recipes. If you included the HPOConfig object, you
  must set PerformHPO to true.
- `"OptimizationMetric"`: The accuracy metric used to optimize the predictor.
- `"PerformAutoML"`: Whether to perform AutoML. When Amazon Forecast performs AutoML, it
  evaluates the algorithms it provides and chooses the best algorithm and configuration for
  your training dataset. The default value is false. In this case, you are required to
  specify an algorithm. Set PerformAutoML to true to have Amazon Forecast perform AutoML.
  This is a good option if you aren't sure which algorithm is suitable for your training
  data. In this case, PerformHPO must be false.
- `"PerformHPO"`: Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO). HPO finds optimal
  hyperparameter values for your training data. The process of performing HPO is known as
  running a hyperparameter tuning job. The default value is false. In this case, Amazon
  Forecast uses default hyperparameter values from the chosen algorithm. To override the
  default values, set PerformHPO to true and, optionally, supply the
  HyperParameterTuningJobConfig object. The tuning job specifies a metric to optimize, which
  hyperparameters participate in tuning, and the valid range for each tunable hyperparameter.
  In this case, you are required to specify an algorithm and PerformAutoML must be false. The
  following algorithms support HPO:   DeepAR+   CNN-QR
- `"Tags"`: The optional metadata that you apply to the predictor to help you categorize
  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you
  define. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per
  resource - 50.   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have
  only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Maximum value
  length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   If your tagging schema is used across multiple
  services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed
  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in
  UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case
  sensitive.   Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a
  prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this
  prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does
  not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50
  tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource
  limit.
- `"TrainingParameters"`: The hyperparameters to override for model training. The
  hyperparameters that you can override are listed in the individual algorithms. For the list
  of supported algorithms, see aws-forecast-choosing-recipes.

    create_what_if_analysis(forecast_arn, what_if_analysis_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

What-if analysis is a scenario modeling technique where you make a hypothetical change to a
time series and compare the forecasts generated by these changes against the baseline,
unchanged time series. It is important to remember that the purpose of a what-if analysis
is to understand how a forecast can change given different modifications to the baseline
time series. For example, imagine you are a clothing retailer who is considering an end of
season sale to clear space for new styles. After creating a baseline forecast, you can use
a what-if analysis to investigate how different sales tactics might affect your goals. You
could create a scenario where everything is given a 25% markdown and another where
everything is given a fixed dollar markdown. You can create a scenario where the sale lasts
for 1 week and another where the sale lasts for 1 month. Your what-if analysis enables you
to compare many different scenarios against each other. Note that a what-if analysis is
meant to display what the forecasting model has learned and how it will behave in the
scenarios that you are evaluating. Do not blindly use the results of the what-if analysis
to make business decisions. For instance, forecasts might not be accurate for novel
scenarios where there is no reference available to determine whether a forecast is good.
The TimeSeriesSelector object defines the items that you want in the what-if analysis.

# Arguments
- `forecast_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the baseline forecast.
- `what_if_analysis_name`: The name of the what-if analysis. Each name must be unique.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Tags"`: A list of tags to apply to the what if forecast.
- `"TimeSeriesSelector"`: Defines the set of time series that are used in the what-if
  analysis with a TimeSeriesIdentifiers object. What-if analyses are performed only for the
  time series in this object. The TimeSeriesIdentifiers object needs the following
  information:    DataSource     Format     Schema

A what-if forecast is a forecast that is created from a modified version of the baseline
forecast. Each what-if forecast incorporates either a replacement dataset or a set of
transformations to the original dataset.

# Arguments
- `what_if_analysis_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if analysis.
- `what_if_forecast_name`: The name of the what-if forecast. Names must be unique within
  each what-if analysis.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Tags"`: A list of tags to apply to the what if forecast.
- `"TimeSeriesReplacementsDataSource"`: The replacement time series dataset, which contains
  the rows that you want to change in the related time series dataset. A replacement time
  series does not need to contain all rows that are in the baseline related time series.
  Include only the rows (measure-dimension combinations) that you want to include in the
  what-if forecast. This dataset is merged with the original time series to create a
  transformed dataset that is used for the what-if analysis. This dataset should contain the
  items to modify (such as item_id or workforce_type), any relevant dimensions, the timestamp
  column, and at least one of the related time series columns. This file should not contain
  duplicate timestamps for the same time series. Timestamps and item_ids not included in this
  dataset are not included in the what-if analysis.
- `"TimeSeriesTransformations"`: The transformations that are applied to the baseline time
  series. Each transformation contains an action and a set of conditions. An action is
  applied only when all conditions are met. If no conditions are provided, the action is
  applied to all items.

conventions:  ≈&lt;ForecastExportJobName&gt;_&lt;ExportTimestamp&gt;_&lt;PartNumber&gt;
The &lt;ExportTimestamp&gt; component is in Java SimpleDateFormat (yyyy-MM-ddTHH-mm-ssZ).
You must specify a DataDestination object that includes an AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket. For
more information, see aws-forecast-iam-roles. For more information, see
howitworks-forecast. To get a list of all your what-if forecast export jobs, use the
ListWhatIfForecastExports operation.  The Status of the forecast export job must be ACTIVE
before you can access the forecast in your Amazon S3 bucket. To get the status, use the
DescribeWhatIfForecastExport operation.

# Arguments
- `destination`: The location where you want to save the forecast and an AWS Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the location. The
  forecast must be exported to an Amazon S3 bucket. If encryption is used, Destination must
  include an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key. The IAM role must allow Amazon Forecast
  permission to access the key.
- `what_if_forecast_arns`: The list of what-if forecast Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to
  export.
- `what_if_forecast_export_name`: The name of the what-if forecast to export.

predictor to generate a forecast. For more information, see Predictor Metrics. This
operation generates metrics for each backtest window that was evaluated. The number of
backtest windows (NumberOfBacktestWindows) is specified using the EvaluationParameters
object, which is optionally included in the CreatePredictor request. If
NumberOfBacktestWindows isn't specified, the number defaults to one. The parameters of the
filling method determine which items contribute to the metrics. If you want all items to
contribute, specify zero. If you want only those items that have complete data in the range
being evaluated to contribute, specify nan. For more information, see FeaturizationMethod.
Before you can get accuracy metrics, the Status of the predictor must be ACTIVE, signifying
that training has completed. To get the status, use the DescribePredictor operation.

# Arguments
- `resource_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the resource for which to

  For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
  Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode
  characters in UTF-8.   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
  resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
  Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and
  the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do
  not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as
  it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can
  have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast
  considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only
  the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.
