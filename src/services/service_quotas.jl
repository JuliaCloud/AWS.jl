    ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas()

Lists all default service quotas for the specified AWS service or all AWS services. ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas is similar to ListServiceQuotas except for the Value object. The Value object returned by ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas is the default value assigned by AWS. This request returns a list of all service quotas for the specified service.
