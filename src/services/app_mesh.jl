    CreateVirtualNode()

Creates a virtual node within a service mesh.
         A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS
         service or a Kubernetes deployment. When you create a virtual node, you can specify the
         service discovery information for your task group.
         Any inbound traffic that your virtual node expects should be specified as a
            listener. Any outbound traffic that your virtual node expects to reach
         should be specified as a backend.
         The response metadata for your new virtual node contains the arn that is
         associated with the virtual node. Set this value (either the full ARN or the truncated
         resource name: for example, mesh/default/virtualNode/simpleapp) as the
            APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_NAME environment variable for your task group's Envoy
         proxy container in your task definition or pod spec. This is then mapped to the
            node.id and node.cluster Envoy parameters.
         
            If you require your Envoy stats or tracing to use a different name, you can override
            the node.cluster value that is set by
               APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_NAME with the
