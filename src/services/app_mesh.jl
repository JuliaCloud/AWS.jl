    CreateMesh()

Creates a service mesh.
          A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between services that are
         represented by resources within the mesh. After you create your service mesh, you can
         create virtual services, virtual nodes, virtual routers, and routes to distribute traffic
         between the applications in your mesh.
         For more information about service meshes, see Service meshes.

Required Parameters
{
  "meshName": "The name to use for the service mesh."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "clientToken": "Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the\nrequest. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.",
  "spec": "The service mesh specification to apply.",
  "tags": "Optional metadata that you can apply to the service mesh to assist with categorization\n         and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you\n         define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have\n            a maximum length of 256 characters."

"""
    CreateRoute()

Creates a route that is associated with a virtual router.
          You can route several different protocols and define a retry policy for a route.
         Traffic can be routed to one or more virtual nodes.
         For more information about routes, see Routes.

Required Parameters
{
  "meshName": "The name of the service mesh to create the route in.",
  "routeName": "The name to use for the route.",

"""
    CreateVirtualNode()

Creates a virtual node within a service mesh.
          A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS
         service or a Kubernetes deployment. When you create a virtual node, you can specify the
         service discovery information for your task group, and whether the proxy running in a task
         group will communicate with other proxies using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
         You define a listener for any inbound traffic that your virtual node
         expects. Any virtual service that your virtual node expects to communicate to is specified
         as a backend.
         The response metadata for your new virtual node contains the arn that is
         associated with the virtual node. Set this value (either the full ARN or the truncated
         resource name: for example, mesh/default/virtualNode/simpleapp) as the
            APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_NAME environment variable for your task group's Envoy
         proxy container in your task definition or pod spec. This is then mapped to the
            node.id and node.cluster Envoy parameters.
         
            If you require your Envoy stats or tracing to use a different name, you can override
            the node.cluster value that is set by
               APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_NAME with the
               APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_CLUSTER environment variable.

    CreateVirtualRouter()

Creates a virtual router within a service mesh.
         Specify a listener for any inbound traffic that your virtual router
         receives. Create a virtual router for each protocol and port that you need to route.
         Virtual routers handle traffic for one or more virtual services within your mesh. After you

         incoming requests to different virtual nodes.

    CreateVirtualService()

Creates a virtual service within a service mesh.
         A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node
         directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router. Dependent services call your virtual
         service by its virtualServiceName, and those requests are routed to the
         virtual node or virtual router that is specified as the provider for the virtual
