    CreateGatewayRoute()

Creates a gateway route. A gateway route is attached to a virtual gateway and routes traffic to an existing virtual service. If a route matches a request, it can distribute traffic to a target virtual service. For more information about gateway routes, see Gateway routes.

# Required Parameters
- `gatewayRouteName`: The name to use for the gateway route.
- `meshName`: The name of the service mesh to create the gateway route in.
- `spec`: The gateway route specification to apply.
- `virtualGatewayName`: The name of the virtual gateway to associate the gateway route with. If the virtual gateway is in a shared mesh, then you must be the owner of the virtual gateway resource.

# Optional Parameters
- `clientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
- `meshOwner`: The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then the account that you specify must share the mesh with your account before you can create the resource in the service mesh. For more information about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes.
- `tags`: Optional metadata that you can apply to the gateway route to assist with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

    CreateMesh()

Creates a service mesh.  A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between services that are represented by resources within the mesh. After you create your service mesh, you can create virtual services, virtual nodes, virtual routers, and routes to distribute traffic between the applications in your mesh. For more information about service meshes, see Service meshes.

"""
    CreateVirtualGateway()

Creates a virtual gateway. A virtual gateway allows resources outside your mesh to communicate to resources that are inside your mesh. The virtual gateway represents an Envoy proxy running in an Amazon ECS task, in a Kubernetes service, or on an Amazon EC2 instance. Unlike a virtual node, which represents an Envoy running with an application, a virtual gateway represents Envoy deployed by itself. For more information about virtual gateways, see Virtual gateways. 

# Required Parameters
- `meshName`: The name of the service mesh to create the virtual gateway in.
- `spec`: The virtual gateway specification to apply.
- `virtualGatewayName`: The name to use for the virtual gateway.

# Optional Parameters
- `clientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.

"""
    CreateVirtualNode()

Creates a virtual node within a service mesh.  A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS service or a Kubernetes deployment. When you create a virtual node, you can specify the service discovery information for your task group, and whether the proxy running in a task group will communicate with other proxies using Transport Layer Security (TLS). You define a listener for any inbound traffic that your virtual node expects. Any virtual service that your virtual node expects to communicate to is specified as a backend. The response metadata for your new virtual node contains the arn that is associated with the virtual node. Set this value to the full ARN; for example, arn:aws:appmesh:us-west-2:123456789012:myMesh/default/virtualNode/myApp) as the APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN environment variable for your task group's Envoy proxy container in your task definition or pod spec. This is then mapped to the node.id and node.cluster Envoy parameters.  By default, App Mesh uses the name of the resource you specified in APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN when Envoy is referring to itself in metrics and traces. You can override this behavior by setting the APPMESH_RESOURCE_CLUSTER environment variable with your own name. AWS Cloud Map is not available in the eu-south-1 Region.  For more information about virtual nodes, see Virtual nodes. You must be using 1.15.0 or later of the Envoy image when setting these variables. For more information about App Mesh Envoy variables, see Envoy image in the AWS App Mesh User Guide.

# Required Parameters
- `meshName`: The name of the service mesh to create the virtual node in.
- `spec`: The virtual node specification to apply.
- `virtualNodeName`: The name to use for the virtual node.

# Optional Parameters
- `clientToken`: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
- `meshOwner`: The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner.
