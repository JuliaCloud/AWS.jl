Creates a container for a collection of data being ingested for analysis. The dataset
contains the metadata describing where the data is and what the data actually looks like.
For example, it contains the location of the data source, the data schema, and other
information. A dataset also contains any tags associated with the ingested data.

# Arguments
- `client_token`:  A unique identifier for the request. If you do not set the client
  request token, Amazon Lookout for Equipment generates one.
- `dataset_name`: The name of the dataset being created.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DatasetSchema"`: A JSON description of the data that is in each time series dataset,
  including names, column names, and data types.

    create_inference_scheduler(client_token, data_input_configuration, data_output_configuration, data_upload_frequency, inference_scheduler_name, model_name, role_arn, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

 Creates a scheduled inference. Scheduling an inference is setting up a continuous
real-time inference plan to analyze new measurement data. When setting up the schedule, you
provide an S3 bucket location for the input data, assign it a delimiter between separate
entries in the data, set an offset delay if desired, and set the frequency of inferencing.
You must also provide an S3 bucket location for the output data.

# Arguments
- `client_token`:  A unique identifier for the request. If you do not set the client
  request token, Amazon Lookout for Equipment generates one.
- `data_input_configuration`: Specifies configuration information for the input data for
  the inference scheduler, including delimiter, format, and dataset location.
- `data_output_configuration`: Specifies configuration information for the output results
  for the inference scheduler, including the S3 location for the output.
- `data_upload_frequency`:  How often data is uploaded to the source Amazon S3 bucket for
  the input data. The value chosen is the length of time between data uploads. For instance,
  if you select 5 minutes, Amazon Lookout for Equipment will upload the real-time data to the
  source bucket once every 5 minutes. This frequency also determines how often Amazon Lookout
  for Equipment runs inference on your data. For more information, see Understanding the
  inference process.
- `inference_scheduler_name`: The name of the inference scheduler being created.
- `model_name`: The name of the previously trained machine learning model being used to
  create the inference scheduler.
- `role_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to access the data
  source being used for the inference.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DataDelayOffsetInMinutes"`: The interval (in minutes) of planned delay at the start of
  each inference segment. For example, if inference is set to run every ten minutes, the
  delay is set to five minutes and the time is 09:08. The inference scheduler will wake up at
  the configured interval (which, without a delay configured, would be 09:10) plus the
  additional five minute delay time (so 09:15) to check your Amazon S3 bucket. The delay
  provides a buffer for you to upload data at the same frequency, so that you don't have to
  stop and restart the scheduler when uploading new data. For more information, see
  Understanding the inference process.
- `"ServerSideKmsKeyId"`: Provides the identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt inference
  scheduler data by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.
- `"Tags"`: Any tags associated with the inference scheduler.

    create_model(client_token, dataset_name, model_name)
    create_model(client_token, dataset_name, model_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a machine learning model for data inference.  A machine-learning (ML) model is a
mathematical model that finds patterns in your data. In Amazon Lookout for Equipment, the
model learns the patterns of normal behavior and detects abnormal behavior that could be
potential equipment failure (or maintenance events). The models are made by analyzing
normal data and abnormalities in machine behavior that have already occurred. Your model is
trained using a portion of the data from your dataset and uses that data to learn patterns
of normal behavior and abnormal patterns that lead to equipment failure. Another portion of
the data is used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

# Arguments
- `client_token`: A unique identifier for the request. If you do not set the client request
  token, Amazon Lookout for Equipment generates one.
- `dataset_name`: The name of the dataset for the machine learning model being created.
- `model_name`: The name for the machine learning model to be created.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DataPreProcessingConfiguration"`: The configuration is the TargetSamplingRate, which is
  the sampling rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equipment. For
  example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second level and you want the
  system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1
  minute. When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate, you must attach the prefix
  \"PT\" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is therefore PT1S, the value for
  a 15 minute rate is PT15M, and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H
- `"DatasetSchema"`: The data schema for the machine learning model being created.
- `"EvaluationDataEndTime"`:  Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be
  used to end the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.
- `"EvaluationDataStartTime"`: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be
  used to begin the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.
- `"LabelsInputConfiguration"`: The input configuration for the labels being used for the
  machine learning model that's being created.
- `"ModelDiagnosticsOutputConfiguration"`: The Amazon S3 location where you want Amazon
  Lookout for Equipment to save the pointwise model diagnostics. You must also specify the
  RoleArn request parameter.
- `"OffCondition"`: Indicates that the asset associated with this sensor has been shut off.
  As long as this condition is met, Lookout for Equipment will not use data from this asset
  for training, evaluation, or inference.
- `"RoleArn"`:  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to access the data
  source being used to create the machine learning model.
- `"ServerSideKmsKeyId"`: Provides the identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt model data
  by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.
- `"Tags"`:  Any tags associated with the machine learning model being created.
- `"TrainingDataEndTime"`: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used
  to end the subset of training data for the machine learning model.
- `"TrainingDataStartTime"`: Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be
  used to begin the subset of training data for the machine learning model.

    update_inference_scheduler(inference_scheduler_name)
    update_inference_scheduler(inference_scheduler_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates an inference scheduler.

# Arguments
- `inference_scheduler_name`: The name of the inference scheduler to be updated.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"DataDelayOffsetInMinutes"`:  A period of time (in minutes) by which inference on the
  data is delayed after the data starts. For instance, if you select an offset delay time of
  five minutes, inference will not begin on the data until the first data measurement after
  the five minute mark. For example, if five minutes is selected, the inference scheduler
  will wake up at the configured frequency with the additional five minute delay time to
  check the customer S3 bucket. The customer can upload data at the same frequency and they
  don't need to stop and restart the scheduler when uploading new data.
- `"DataInputConfiguration"`:  Specifies information for the input data for the inference
  scheduler, including delimiter, format, and dataset location.
- `"DataOutputConfiguration"`:  Specifies information for the output results from the
  inference scheduler, including the output S3 location.
- `"DataUploadFrequency"`: How often data is uploaded to the source S3 bucket for the input
  data. The value chosen is the length of time between data uploads. For instance, if you
  select 5 minutes, Amazon Lookout for Equipment will upload the real-time data to the source
  bucket once every 5 minutes. This frequency also determines how often Amazon Lookout for
  Equipment starts a scheduled inference on your data. In this example, it starts once every
  5 minutes.
- `"RoleArn"`:  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to access the data
  source for the inference scheduler.
