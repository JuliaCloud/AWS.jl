    CreateApplicationVersion()

Creates an application version for the specified application. You can create an application version from a source bundle in Amazon S3, a commit in AWS CodeCommit, or the output of an AWS CodeBuild build as follows: Specify a commit in an AWS CodeCommit repository with SourceBuildInformation. Specify a build in an AWS CodeBuild with SourceBuildInformation and BuildConfiguration. Specify a source bundle in S3 with SourceBundle  Omit both SourceBuildInformation and SourceBundle to use the default sample application.  After you create an application version with a specified Amazon S3 bucket and key location, you can't change that Amazon S3 location. If you change the Amazon S3 location, you receive an exception when you attempt to launch an environment from the application version. 

# Required Parameters
- `ApplicationName`:  The name of the application. If no application is found with this name, and AutoCreateApplication is false, returns an InvalidParameterValue error. 
- `VersionLabel`: A label identifying this version. Constraint: Must be unique per application. If an application version already exists with this label for the specified application, AWS Elastic Beanstalk returns an InvalidParameterValue error. 

# Optional Parameters
- `AutoCreateApplication`: Set to true to create an application with the specified name if it doesn't already exist.

You must turn processing on for application versions that you create using AWS CodeBuild or AWS CodeCommit. For application versions built from a source bundle in Amazon S3, processing is optional.  The Process option validates Elastic Beanstalk configuration files. It doesn't validate your application's configuration files, like proxy server or Docker configuration. 
- `SourceBuildInformation`: Specify a commit in an AWS CodeCommit Git repository to use as the source code for the application version.
- `SourceBundle`: The Amazon S3 bucket and key that identify the location of the source bundle for this version.  The Amazon S3 bucket must be in the same region as the environment.  Specify a source bundle in S3 or a commit in an AWS CodeCommit repository (with SourceBuildInformation), but not both.

    CreateConfigurationTemplate()

Creates an AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration template, associated with a specific Elastic Beanstalk application. You define application configuration settings in a configuration template.

- `PlatformArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom platform. For more information, see  Custom Platforms in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide.  If you specify PlatformArn, then don't specify SolutionStackName. 
- `SolutionStackName`: The name of an Elastic Beanstalk solution stack (platform version) that this configuration uses. For example, 64bit Amazon Linux 2013.09 running Tomcat 7 Java 7. A solution stack specifies the operating system, runtime, and application server for a configuration template. It also determines the set of configuration options as well as the possible and default values. For more information, see Supported Platforms in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide. You must specify SolutionStackName if you don't specify PlatformArn, EnvironmentId, or SourceConfiguration. Use the  ListAvailableSolutionStacks  API to obtain a list of available solution stacks.

    CreateEnvironment()

Launches an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment for the specified application using the specified configuration.

# Required Parameters
- `ApplicationName`: The name of the application that is associated with this environment.

# Optional Parameters
- `CNAMEPrefix`: If specified, the environment attempts to use this value as the prefix for the CNAME in your Elastic Beanstalk environment URL. If not specified, the CNAME is generated automatically by appending a random alphanumeric string to the environment name.

- `EnvironmentName`: A unique name for the environment. Constraint: Must be from 4 to 40 characters in length. The name can contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. It can't start or end with a hyphen. This name must be unique within a region in your account. If the specified name already exists in the region, Elastic Beanstalk returns an InvalidParameterValue error.  If you don't specify the CNAMEPrefix parameter, the environment name becomes part of the CNAME, and therefore part of the visible URL for your application.
- `GroupName`: The name of the group to which the target environment belongs. Specify a group name only if the environment's name is specified in an environment manifest and not with the environment name parameter. See Environment Manifest (env.yaml) for details.
- `OperationsRole`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to be used as the environment's operations role. If specified, Elastic Beanstalk uses the operations role for permissions to downstream services during this call and during subsequent calls acting on this environment.

If specified, Elastic Beanstalk sets the configuration values to the default values associated with the specified solution stack. For a list of current solution stacks, see Elastic Beanstalk Supported Platforms in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms guide.  If you specify SolutionStackName, don't specify PlatformArn or TemplateName.

- `TemplateName`: The name of the Elastic Beanstalk configuration template to use with the environment.  If you specify TemplateName, then don't specify SolutionStackName.
