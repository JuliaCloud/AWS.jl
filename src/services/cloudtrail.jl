    add_tags(resource_id, tags_list)
    add_tags(resource_id, tags_list, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Adds one or more tags to a trail, event data store, or channel, up to a limit of 50.
Overwrites an existing tag's value when a new value is specified for an existing tag key.
Tag key names must be unique; you cannot have two keys with the same name but different
values. If you specify a key without a value, the tag will be created with the specified
key and a value of null. You can tag a trail or event data store that applies to all Amazon
Web Services Regions only from the Region in which the trail or event data store was
created (also known as its home Region).

# Arguments
- `resource_id`: Specifies the ARN of the trail, event data store, or channel to which one
  or more tags will be added. The format of a trail ARN is:
  arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail  The format of an event data store
  ARN is:

    create_event_data_store(name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a new event data store.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the event data store.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AdvancedEventSelectors"`: The advanced event selectors to use to select the events for
  the data store. You can configure up to five advanced event selectors for each event data
  store.  For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to log CloudTrail
  events, see Log events by using advanced event selectors in the CloudTrail User Guide. For
  more information about how to use advanced event selectors to include Config configuration
  items in your event data store, see Create an event data store for Config configuration
  items in the CloudTrail User Guide. For more information about how to use advanced event
  selectors to include non-Amazon Web Services events in your event data store, see Create an
  integration to log events from outside Amazon Web Services in the CloudTrail User Guide.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
  CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by alias/, a fully specified ARN to an
  alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.  Disabling or
  deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail
  from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in
  the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data
  store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or
  delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event
  data store.  CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about
  multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer
  Guide. Examples:    alias/MyAliasName
  arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
  arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
  12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
- `"MultiRegionEnabled"`: Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all
  Regions, or only from the Region in which the event data store is created.
- `"OrganizationEnabled"`: Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for
  an organization in Organizations.
- `"RetentionPeriod"`: The retention period of the event data store, in days. You can set a
  retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.
- `"StartIngestion"`: Specifies whether the event data store should start ingesting live
  events. The default is true.
- `"TagsList"`:
- `"TerminationProtectionEnabled"`: Specifies whether termination protection is enabled for
  the event data store. If termination protection is enabled, you cannot delete the event
  data store until termination protection is disabled.

"""
    create_trail(name, s3_bucket_name)
    create_trail(name, s3_bucket_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a trail that specifies the settings for delivery of log data to an Amazon S3
bucket.

# Arguments
- `name`: Specifies the name of the trail. The name must meet the following requirements:
  Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or
  dashes (-)   Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number   Be between 3
  and 128 characters   Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like
  my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.   Not be in IP address format (for example,
  192.168.5.4)
- `s3_bucket_name`: Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
  log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn"`: Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name
  (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be
  delivered. You must use a log group that exists in your account. Not required unless you
  specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.
- `"CloudWatchLogsRoleArn"`: Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume
  to write to a user's log group. You must use a role that exists in your account.
- `"EnableLogFileValidation"`: Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled.
  The default is false.  When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest
  files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not create digest files for log files that
  were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For
  example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at
  noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created
  for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies
  whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.
- `"IncludeGlobalServiceEvents"`: Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from
  global services such as IAM to the log files.
- `"IsMultiRegionTrail"`: Specifies whether the trail is created in the current Region or
  in all Regions. The default is false, which creates a trail only in the Region where you
  are signed in. As a best practice, consider creating trails that log events in all Regions.
- `"IsOrganizationTrail"`: Specifies whether the trail is created for all accounts in an
  organization in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web Services account. The
  default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an Amazon Web
  Services account that is the management account or delegated administrator account for an
  organization in Organizations.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
  CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by alias/, a fully specified ARN to an
  alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier. CloudTrail also
  supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using
  multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Examples:
  alias/MyAliasName     arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
  arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
  12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
- `"S3KeyPrefix"`: Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
  bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see Finding Your
  CloudTrail Log Files. The maximum length is 200 characters.
- `"SnsTopicName"`: Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of
  log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
- `"TagsList"`:

Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail. Use event

your trail. If you want your trail to log Insights events, be sure the event selector
enables logging of the Insights event types you want configured for your trail. For more
information about logging Insights events, see Logging Insights events for trails in the

configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event
occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event
selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail
processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail
doesn't log the event. Example   You create an event selector for a trail and specify that
you want write-only events.   The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances API operations
occur in your account.   CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event
selectors.   The RunInstances is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The
trail logs the event.   The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event that doesn't match your
event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.    The PutEventSelectors operation must be
called from the Region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an
InvalidHomeRegionException exception is thrown. You can configure up to five event
selectors for each trail. For more information, see Logging management events, Logging data
events, and Quotas in CloudTrail in the CloudTrail User Guide. You can add advanced event
selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values
for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or
EventSelectors, but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a trail, any existing
EventSelectors are overwritten. For more information about advanced event selectors, see
Logging data events in the CloudTrail User Guide.

# Arguments
- `trail_name`: Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail name,
  the string must meet the following requirements:   Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),
  numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or dashes (-)   Start with a letter or number,
  and end with a letter or number   Be between 3 and 128 characters   Have no adjacent
  periods, underscores or dashes. Names like my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.
  Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)   If you specify a trail ARN, it
  must be in the following format.  arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AdvancedEventSelectors"`:  Specifies the settings for advanced event selectors. You can
  add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a
  maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either
  AdvancedEventSelectors or EventSelectors, but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors
  to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are overwritten. For more information about
  advanced event selectors, see Logging data events in the CloudTrail User Guide.

Lets you enable Insights event logging by specifying the Insights selectors that you want
to enable on an existing trail. You also use PutInsightSelectors to turn off Insights event
logging, by passing an empty list of insight types. The valid Insights event types in this
release are ApiErrorRateInsight and ApiCallRateInsight. To log CloudTrail Insights events
on API call volume, the trail must log write management events. To log CloudTrail Insights
events on API error rate, the trail must log read or write management events. You can call
GetEventSelectors on a trail to check whether the trail logs management events.

# Arguments
- `insight_selectors`: A JSON string that contains the insight types you want to log on a
  trail. ApiCallRateInsight and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid Insight types. The
  ApiCallRateInsight Insights type analyzes write-only management API calls that are
  aggregated per minute against a baseline API call volume. The ApiErrorRateInsight Insights
  type analyzes management API calls that result in error codes. The error is shown if the
  API call is unsuccessful.

CloudTrail prefix and the prefixes inside the CloudTrail prefix, and does not check
prefixes for other Amazon Web Services services. If you want to import CloudTrail events
contained in another prefix, you must include the prefix in the S3LocationUri. For more
considerations about importing trail events, see Considerations.   When you start a new
import, the Destinations and ImportSource parameters are required. Before starting a new
import, disable any access control lists (ACLs) attached to the source S3 bucket. For more
information about disabling ACLs, see Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs
for your bucket.   When you retry an import, the ImportID parameter is required.    If the
destination event data store is for an organization, you must use the management account to
import trail events. You cannot use the delegated administrator account for the
organization.

- `"EndEventTime"`:  Use with StartEventTime to bound a StartImport request, and limit
  imported trail events to only those events logged within a specified time period. When you
  specify a time range, CloudTrail checks the prefix and log file names to verify the names
  contain a date between the specified StartEventTime and EndEventTime before attempting to

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AdvancedEventSelectors"`: The advanced event selectors used to select events for the
  event data store. You can configure up to five advanced event selectors for each event data
  store.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
  CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by alias/, a fully specified ARN to an
  alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.  Disabling or
  deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail
  from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in
  the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data
  store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or
  delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event
  data store.  CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about
  multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer
  Guide. Examples:    alias/MyAliasName
  arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
  arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
  12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
- `"MultiRegionEnabled"`: Specifies whether an event data store collects events from all
  Regions, or only from the Region in which it was created.
- `"Name"`: The event data store name.
- `"OrganizationEnabled"`: Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for
  an organization in Organizations.
- `"RetentionPeriod"`: The retention period, in days.
- `"TerminationProtectionEnabled"`: Indicates that termination protection is enabled and
  the event data store cannot be automatically deleted.

"""
    update_trail(name)
    update_trail(name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Updates trail settings that control what events you are logging, and how to handle log
files. Changes to a trail do not require stopping the CloudTrail service. Use this action
to designate an existing bucket for log delivery. If the existing bucket has previously
been a target for CloudTrail log files, an IAM policy exists for the bucket. UpdateTrail
must be called from the Region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an
InvalidHomeRegionException is thrown.

# Arguments
- `name`: Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If Name is a trail name, the string
  must meet the following requirements:   Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers
  (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or dashes (-)   Start with a letter or number, and end
  with a letter or number   Be between 3 and 128 characters   Have no adjacent periods,
  underscores or dashes. Names like my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.   Not be
  in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)   If Name is a trail ARN, it must be in the
  following format.  arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn"`: Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name
  (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs are
  delivered. You must use a log group that exists in your account. Not required unless you
  specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.
- `"CloudWatchLogsRoleArn"`: Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume
  to write to a user's log group. You must use a role that exists in your account.
- `"EnableLogFileValidation"`: Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The
  default is false.  When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest
  files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not create digest files for log files that
  were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For
  example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at
  noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created
  for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies
  whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.
- `"IncludeGlobalServiceEvents"`: Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from
  global services such as IAM to the log files.
- `"IsMultiRegionTrail"`: Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current Region or
  to all Regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only in the current Region and
  this value is set to true, shadow trails (replications of the trail) will be created in the
  other Regions. If the trail exists in all Regions and this value is set to false, the trail
  will remain in the Region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other Regions will
  be deleted. As a best practice, consider using trails that log events in all Regions.
- `"IsOrganizationTrail"`: Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an
  organization in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web Services account. The
  default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an Amazon Web
  Services account that is the management account or delegated administrator account for an
  organization in Organizations. If the trail is not an organization trail and this is set to
  true, the trail will be created in all Amazon Web Services accounts that belong to the
  organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is set to false, the trail
  will remain in the current Amazon Web Services account but be deleted from all member
  accounts in the organization.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
  CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by \"alias/\", a fully specified ARN to
  an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier. CloudTrail also
  supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using
  multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Examples:
  alias/MyAliasName   arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
  arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
  12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
- `"S3BucketName"`: Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
  log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements.
- `"S3KeyPrefix"`: Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
  bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see Finding Your
  CloudTrail Log Files. The maximum length is 200 characters.
- `"SnsTopicName"`: Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of
  log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
