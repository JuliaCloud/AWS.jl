    add_tags(resource_id)
    add_tags(resource_id, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Adds one or more tags to a trail, up to a limit of 50. Overwrites an existing tag's value
when a new value is specified for an existing tag key. Tag key names must be unique for a
trail; you cannot have two keys with the same name but different values. If you specify a
key without a value, the tag will be created with the specified key and a value of null.
You can tag a trail that applies to all AWS Regions only from the Region in which the trail
was created (also known as its home region).

# Arguments
- `resource_id`: Specifies the ARN of the trail to which one or more tags will be added.
  The format of a trail ARN is:  arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"TagsList"`: Contains a list of CloudTrail tags, up to a limit of 50

    create_trail(name, s3_bucket_name)
    create_trail(name, s3_bucket_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Creates a trail that specifies the settings for delivery of log data to an Amazon S3
bucket.

# Arguments
- `name`: Specifies the name of the trail. The name must meet the following requirements:
  Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or
  dashes (-)   Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number   Be between 3
  and 128 characters   Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like
  my-_namespace and my--namespace are invalid.   Not be in IP address format (for example,
  192.168.5.4)
- `s3_bucket_name`: Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
  log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn"`: Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name
  (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be
  delivered. Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.
- `"CloudWatchLogsRoleArn"`: Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume
  to write to a user's log group.
- `"EnableLogFileValidation"`: Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled.
  The default is false.  When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest
  files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail will not create digest files for log files that
  were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For
  example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at
  noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created
  for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies
  whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.
- `"IncludeGlobalServiceEvents"`: Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from
  global services such as IAM to the log files.
- `"IsMultiRegionTrail"`: Specifies whether the trail is created in the current region or
  in all regions. The default is false, which creates a trail only in the region where you
  are signed in. As a best practice, consider creating trails that log events in all regions.
- `"IsOrganizationTrail"`: Specifies whether the trail is created for all accounts in an
  organization in AWS Organizations, or only for the current AWS account. The default is
  false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an AWS account that is the
  master account for an organization in AWS Organizations.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
  CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by \"alias/\", a fully specified ARN to
  an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier. Examples:
  alias/MyAliasName   arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
  arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
  12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
- `"S3KeyPrefix"`: Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
  bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see Finding Your
  CloudTrail Log Files. The maximum length is 200 characters.
- `"SnsTopicName"`: Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of
  log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
- `"TagsList"`:

    put_event_selectors(trail_name)
    put_event_selectors(trail_name, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail. Use event
selectors or advanced event selectors to specify management and data event settings for
your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to
log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your
account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all
trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and
logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the
event.  Example   You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want
write-only events.   The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances API operations occur in your
account.   CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.   The
RunInstances is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the
event.   The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event that doesn't match your event selector.
The trail doesn't log the event.    The PutEventSelectors operation must be called from the
region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException exception
is thrown. You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more
information, see Logging data and management events for trails  and Quotas in AWS
CloudTrail in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide. You can add advanced event selectors, and
conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all
conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or
EventSelectors, but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a trail, any existing
EventSelectors are overwritten. For more information about advanced event selectors, see
Logging data events for trails in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.

- `"CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn"`: Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name
  (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be
  delivered. Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.
- `"CloudWatchLogsRoleArn"`: Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume
  to write to a user's log group.
- `"EnableLogFileValidation"`: Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The
  default is false.  When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest
  files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail will not create digest files for log files that
  were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For
  example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at
  noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created
  for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies
  whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.
- `"IncludeGlobalServiceEvents"`: Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from
  global services such as IAM to the log files.
- `"IsMultiRegionTrail"`: Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current region or
  to all regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only in the current region and
  this value is set to true, shadow trails (replications of the trail) will be created in the
  other regions. If the trail exists in all regions and this value is set to false, the trail
  will remain in the region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other regions will
  be deleted. As a best practice, consider using trails that log events in all regions.
- `"IsOrganizationTrail"`: Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an
  organization in AWS Organizations, or only for the current AWS account. The default is
  false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an AWS account that is the
  master account for an organization in AWS Organizations. If the trail is not an
  organization trail and this is set to true, the trail will be created in all AWS accounts
  that belong to the organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is set to
  false, the trail will remain in the current AWS account but be deleted from all member
  accounts in the organization.
- `"KmsKeyId"`: Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
  CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by \"alias/\", a fully specified ARN to
  an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier. Examples:
  alias/MyAliasName   arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
  arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
  12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
- `"S3BucketName"`: Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
  log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements.
- `"S3KeyPrefix"`: Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
  bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see Finding Your
  CloudTrail Log Files. The maximum length is 200 characters.
- `"SnsTopicName"`: Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of
  log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
