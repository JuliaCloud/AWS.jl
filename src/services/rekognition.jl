    compare_faces(source_image, target_image; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Compares a face in the source input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in
the target input image.   If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects
the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.
CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is
an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence
score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false
negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images.
If you plan to use CompareFaces to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights,
privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review
and further validation before taking action.  You pass the input and target images either
as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use
the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The
image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.  In response, the operation returns an array
of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the
response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, roll,
and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of
confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity
score, which indicates how closely the faces match.   By default, only faces with a
similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can
change this value by specifying the SimilarityThreshold parameter.   CompareFaces also
returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a
bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also
returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the
face and confidence value. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out
detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a
variety of common use cases. Use QualityFilter to set the quality bar by specifying LOW,
MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE. The default
value is NONE.  If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, CompareFaces returns
orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the
images with the correct image orientation. If no faces are detected in the source or target
images, CompareFaces returns an InvalidParameterException error.    This is a stateless API
operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.  For an example, see
Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. This operation
requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CompareFaces action.

# Arguments
- `source_image`: The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the
  AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not
  supported.  If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to
  base64-encode image bytes passed using the Bytes field. For more information, see Images in
  the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.
- `target_image`: The target image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the
  AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not
  supported.  If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to
  base64-encode image bytes passed using the Bytes field. For more information, see Images in
  the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.

# Keyword Parameters
- `quality_filter`: A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to
  identify faces. Filtered faces aren't compared. If you specify AUTO, Amazon Rekognition
  chooses the quality bar. If you specify LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, filtering removes all faces
  that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common
  use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an
  object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose
  that's too extreme to use. If you specify NONE, no filtering is performed. The default
  value is NONE.  To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated
  with version 3 of the face model or higher.
- `similarity_threshold`: The minimum level of confidence in the face matches that a match
  must meet to be included in the FaceMatches array.

    create_dataset(dataset_type, project_arn; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Creates a new Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels dataset. You can create a dataset by using
an Amazon Sagemaker format manifest file or by copying an existing Amazon Rekognition
Custom Labels dataset. To create a training dataset for a project, specify train for the
value of DatasetType. To create the test dataset for a project, specify test for the value
of DatasetType.  The response from CreateDataset is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
dataset. Creating a dataset takes a while to complete. Use DescribeDataset to check the
current status. The dataset created successfully if the value of Status is CREATE_COMPLETE.
 To check if any non-terminal errors occurred, call ListDatasetEntries and check for the
presence of errors lists in the JSON Lines. Dataset creation fails if a terminal error
occurs (Status = CREATE_FAILED). Currently, you can't access the terminal error
information.  For more information, see Creating dataset in the Amazon Rekognition Custom

"""
    create_project_version(output_config, project_arn, version_name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Creates a new version of a model and begins training. Models are managed as part of an
Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project. The response from CreateProjectVersion is an
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the version of the model.  Training uses the training and
test datasets associated with the project. For more information, see Creating training and
test dataset in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide.   You can train a
modelin a project that doesn't have associated datasets by specifying manifest files in the
TrainingData and TestingData fields.  If you open the console after training a model with
manifest files, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels creates the datasets for you using the
most recent manifest files. You can no longer train a model version for the project by
specifying manifest files.  Instead of training with a project without associated datasets,
we recommend that you use the manifest files to create training and test datasets for the
project.  Training takes a while to complete. You can get the current status by calling
DescribeProjectVersions. Training completed successfully if the value of the Status field
is TRAINING_COMPLETED. If training fails, see Debugging a failed model training in the
Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels developer guide.  Once training has successfully
completed, call DescribeProjectVersions to get the training results and evaluate the model.
For more information, see Improving a trained Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model in the
Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels developers guide.  After evaluating the model, you start
the model by calling StartProjectVersion. This operation requires permissions to perform
the rekognition:CreateProjectVersion action.

# Arguments
- `output_config`: The Amazon S3 bucket location to store the results of training. The S3
  bucket can be in any AWS account as long as the caller has s3:PutObject permissions on the
  S3 bucket.
- `project_arn`: The ARN of the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project that manages the
  model that you want to train.
- `version_name`: A name for the version of the model. This value must be unique.

# Keyword Parameters
- `kms_key_id`: The identifier for your AWS Key Management Service key (AWS KMS key). You
  can supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key, the ID of your KMS key, an alias
  for your KMS key, or an alias ARN. The key is used to encrypt training and test images
  copied into the service for model training. Your source images are unaffected. The key is
  also used to encrypt training results and manifest files written to the output Amazon S3
  bucket (OutputConfig). If you choose to use your own KMS key, you need the following
  permissions on the KMS key.   kms:CreateGrant   kms:DescribeKey   kms:GenerateDataKey
  kms:Decrypt   If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId, images copied into the service are
  encrypted using a key that AWS owns and manages.
- `tags`:  A set of tags (key-value pairs) that you want to attach to the model.
- `testing_data`: Specifies an external manifest that the service uses to test the model.
  If you specify TestingData you must also specify TrainingData. The project must not have
  any associated datasets.
- `training_data`: Specifies an external manifest that the services uses to train the
  model. If you specify TrainingData you must also specify TestingData. The project must not
  have any associated datasets.

input parameter.  You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference
to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition
operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG
formatted file.   For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API
returns a (CustomLabel) object in an array (CustomLabels). Each CustomLabel object provides
the label name (Name), the level of confidence that the image contains the object
(Confidence), and object location information, if it exists, for the label on the image
(Geometry).  To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for MinConfidence.
DetectCustomLabelsLabels only returns labels with a confidence that's higher than the
specified value. The value of MinConfidence maps to the assumed threshold values created
during training. For more information, see Assumed threshold in the Amazon Rekognition
Custom Labels Developer Guide. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels metrics expresses an
assumed threshold as a floating point value between 0-1. The range of MinConfidence
normalizes the threshold value to a percentage value (0-100). Confidence responses from
DetectCustomLabels are also returned as a percentage. You can use MinConfidence to change
the precision and recall or your model. For more information, see Analyzing an image in the
Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide.  If you don't specify a value for
MinConfidence, DetectCustomLabels returns labels based on the assumed threshold of each
label. This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.
This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectCustomLabels action.
For more information, see Analyzing an image in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels
Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `image`:
- `project_version_arn`: The ARN of the model version that you want to use.

# Keyword Parameters
- `max_results`: Maximum number of results you want the service to return in the response.
  The service returns the specified number of highest confidence labels ranked from highest
  confidence to lowest.
- `min_confidence`: Specifies the minimum confidence level for the labels to return.
  DetectCustomLabels doesn't return any labels with a confidence value that's lower than this
  specified value. If you specify a value of 0, DetectCustomLabels returns all labels,
  regardless of the assumed threshold applied to each label. If you don't specify a value for
  MinConfidence, DetectCustomLabels returns labels based on the assumed threshold of each

"""
    detect_faces(image; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Detects faces within an image that is provided as input.  DetectFaces detects the 100
largest faces in the image. For each face detected, the operation returns face details.
These details include a bounding box of the face, a confidence value (that the bounding box
contains a face), and a fixed set of attributes such as facial landmarks (for example,
coordinates of eye and mouth), presence of beard, sunglasses, and so on.  The
face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured
faces, the algorithm might not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower
confidence.  You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a
reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon
Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a
PNG or JPEG formatted file.   This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation
does not persist any data.  This operation requires permissions to perform the
rekognition:DetectFaces action.

# Arguments
- `image`: The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI
  to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported.
   If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to
  base64-encode image bytes passed using the Bytes field. For more information, see Images in
  the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.

# Keyword Parameters
- `attributes`: An array of facial attributes you want to be returned. This can be the
  default list of attributes or all attributes. If you don't specify a value for Attributes
  or if you specify [\"DEFAULT\"], the API returns the following subset of facial attributes:
  BoundingBox, Confidence, Pose, Quality, and Landmarks. If you provide [\"ALL\"], all facial
  attributes are returned, but the operation takes longer to complete. If you provide both,
  [\"ALL\", \"DEFAULT\"], the service uses a logical AND operator to determine which
  attributes to return (in this case, all attributes).

"""
    detect_labels(image; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input.
This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and
birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature.  For an example, see
Analyzing Images Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
DetectLabels does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is
supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see StartLabelDetection in
the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.  You pass the input image as base64-encoded image
bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call
Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be
either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   For each object, scene, and concept the API returns
one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that
the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the
sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.   {Name:
lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}   {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}    {Name:
sea,Confidence: 75.061}  In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each
of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in
the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the
operation might return the following three labels.   {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}
{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}  In this example, the
detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip. In response, the API
returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation
correction. Optionally, you can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold
for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the MaxLabels parameter to
limit the number of labels returned.   If the object detected is a person, the operation
doesn't provide the same facial details that the DetectFaces operation provides.
DetectLabels returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of
Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, for the location of the
label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.
 DetectLabels also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a
detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle
(its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of
ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous
example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.
This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data. This
operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectLabels action.

# Arguments
- `image`: The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI
  to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. Images stored
  in an S3 Bucket do not need to be base64-encoded. If you are using an AWS SDK to call
  Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the Bytes
  field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.

# Keyword Parameters
- `max_labels`: Maximum number of labels you want the service to return in the response.
  The service returns the specified number of highest confidence labels.
- `min_confidence`: Specifies the minimum confidence level for the labels to return. Amazon
  Rekognition doesn't return any labels with confidence lower than this specified value. If
  MinConfidence is not specified, the operation returns labels with a confidence values
  greater than or equal to 55 percent.

DetectProtectiveEquipment detects PPE worn by up to 15 persons detected in an image. For
each person detected in the image the API returns an array of body parts (face, head,
left-hand, right-hand). For each body part, an array of detected items of PPE is returned,
including an indicator of whether or not the PPE covers the body part. The API returns the
confidence it has in each detection (person, PPE, body part and body part coverage). It
also returns a bounding box (BoundingBox) for each detected person and each detected item
of PPE.  You can optionally request a summary of detected PPE items with the
SummarizationAttributes input parameter. The summary provides the following information.
The persons detected as wearing all of the types of PPE that you specify.   The persons

    detect_text(image; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Detects text in the input image and converts it into machine-readable text. Pass the input
image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket.
If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, you must pass it as a
reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. For the AWS CLI, passing image bytes is not
supported. The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file.  The DetectText
operation returns text in an array of TextDetection elements, TextDetections. Each
TextDetection element provides information about a single word or line of text that was
detected in the image.  A word is one or more script characters that are not separated by
spaces. DetectText can detect up to 100 words in an image. A line is a string of equally
spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license
number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a
line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words.
This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple
lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If
a sentence spans multiple lines, the DetectText operation returns multiple lines. To
determine whether a TextDetection element is a line of text or a word, use the
TextDetection object Type field.  To be detected, text must be within +/- 90 degrees
orientation of the horizontal axis. For more information, see DetectText in the Amazon
Rekognition Developer Guide.

Analysis is started by a call to StartCelebrityRecognition which returns a job identifier
(JobId).  When the celebrity recognition operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video
publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in
the initial call to StartCelebrityRecognition. To get the results of the celebrity
recognition analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic
is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetCelebrityDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from

Videos in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.  GetCelebrityRecognition returns detected
celebrities and the time(s) they are detected in an array (Celebrities) of
CelebrityRecognition objects. Each CelebrityRecognition contains information about the
celebrity in a CelebrityDetail object and the time, Timestamp, the celebrity was detected.
This CelebrityDetail object stores information about the detected celebrity's face
attributes, a face bounding box, known gender, the celebrity's name, and a confidence
estimate.   GetCelebrityRecognition only returns the default facial attributes
(BoundingBox, Confidence, Landmarks, Pose, and Quality). The BoundingBox field only applies
to the detected face instance. The other facial attributes listed in the Face object of the
following response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail in the
Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.   By default, the Celebrities array is sorted by time
(milliseconds from the start of the video). You can also sort the array by celebrity by
specifying the value ID in the SortBy input parameter. The CelebrityDetail object includes
the celebrity identifer and additional information urls. If you don't store the additional
information urls, you can get them later by calling GetCelebrityInfo with the celebrity
identifer. No information is returned for faces not recognized as celebrities. Use
MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than
specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response contains a

Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification
Service topic registered in the initial call to StartPersonTracking. To get the results of
the person path tracking operation, first check that the status value published to the
Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetPersonTracking and pass the job identifier
(JobId) from the initial call to StartPersonTracking.  GetPersonTracking returns an array,
Persons, of tracked persons and the time(s) their paths were tracked in the video.
GetPersonTracking only returns the default facial attributes (BoundingBox, Confidence,
Landmarks, Pose, and Quality). The other facial attributes listed in the Face object of the
following response syntax are not returned.  For more information, see FaceDetail in the
Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.  By default, the array is sorted by the time(s) a
person's path is tracked in the video. You can sort by tracked persons by specifying INDEX
for the SortBy input parameter. Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of items
returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in
the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To
get the next page of results, call GetPersonTracking and populate the NextToken request
parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to GetPersonTracking.

# Arguments
- `job_id`: The identifier for a job that tracks persons in a video. You get the JobId from
  a call to StartPersonTracking.

# Keyword Parameters
- `max_results`: Maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value
  you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value greater than 1000, a maximum of 1000
  results is returned. The default value is 1000.
- `next_token`: If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more persons to
  retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination token in the response. You can use
  this pagination token to retrieve the next set of persons.
- `sort_by`: Sort to use for elements in the Persons array. Use TIMESTAMP to sort array
  elements by the time persons are detected. Use INDEX to sort by the tracked persons. If you
  sort by INDEX, the array elements for each person are sorted by detection confidence. The
  default sort is by TIMESTAMP.

    index_faces(collection_id, image; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.  Amazon
Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying
detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the
algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend
database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search
operations using the SearchFaces and SearchFacesByImage operations. For more information,
see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. To get the
number of faces in a collection, call DescribeCollection.  If you're using version 1.0 of
the face detection model, IndexFaces indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later
versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.  If
you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not
returned in the OrientationCorrection field.  To determine which version of the model
you're using, call DescribeCollection and supply the collection ID. You can also get the
model version from the value of FaceModelVersion in the response from IndexFaces  For more
information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. If you provide
the optional ExternalImageId for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition
associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the ListFaces operation,
the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a
client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to
find all faces in an image. You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the
MaxFaces input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an
image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in
the background. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces
that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common
use cases. By default, IndexFaces chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You
can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use QualityFilter, to set the quality bar by
specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE.
  To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face
model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call
DescribeCollection.   Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is
returned in an array of UnindexedFace objects, UnindexedFaces. Faces aren't indexed for
reasons such as:   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the MaxFaces request
parameter.   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.   The face is too
blurry.   The image is too dark.   The face has an extreme pose.   The face doesn’t have
enough detail to be suitable for face search.   In response, the IndexFaces operation
returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, FaceRecords. This includes:    The
bounding box, BoundingBox, of the detected face.    A confidence value, Confidence, which
indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.   A face ID, FaceId,
assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.   An image ID, ImageId,
assigned by the service for the input image.   If you request all facial attributes (by
using the detectionAttributes parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial
attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other
facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the
same external ID in the IndexFaces operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate
face metadata.  The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a
reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon
Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as
a PNG or JPEG file.  This operation requires permissions to perform the
rekognition:IndexFaces action.

# Arguments
- `collection_id`: The ID of an existing collection to which you want to add the faces that
  are detected in the input images.
- `image`: The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI
  to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes isn't supported.
  If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode
  image bytes passed using the Bytes field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon
  Rekognition developer guide.

# Keyword Parameters
- `detection_attributes`: An array of facial attributes that you want to be returned. This
  can be the default list of attributes or all attributes. If you don't specify a value for
  Attributes or if you specify [\"DEFAULT\"], the API returns the following subset of facial
  attributes: BoundingBox, Confidence, Pose, Quality, and Landmarks. If you provide
  [\"ALL\"], all facial attributes are returned, but the operation takes longer to complete.
  If you provide both, [\"ALL\", \"DEFAULT\"], the service uses a logical AND operator to
  determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes).
- `external_image_id`: The ID you want to assign to all the faces detected in the image.
- `max_faces`: The maximum number of faces to index. The value of MaxFaces must be greater
  than or equal to 1. IndexFaces returns no more than 100 detected faces in an image, even if
  you specify a larger value for MaxFaces. If IndexFaces detects more faces than the value of
  MaxFaces, the faces with the lowest quality are filtered out first. If there are still more
  faces than the value of MaxFaces, the faces with the smallest bounding boxes are filtered
  out (up to the number that's needed to satisfy the value of MaxFaces). Information about
  the unindexed faces is available in the UnindexedFaces array.  The faces that are returned
  by IndexFaces are sorted by the largest face bounding box size to the smallest size, in
  descending order.  MaxFaces can be used with a collection associated with any version of
  the face model.
- `quality_filter`: A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to
  identify faces. Filtered faces aren't indexed. If you specify AUTO, Amazon Rekognition
  chooses the quality bar. If you specify LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, filtering removes all faces
  that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The default value is AUTO. The quality bar is
  based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of
  reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too
  blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify NONE, no filtering
  is performed.  To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated
  with version 3 of the face model or higher.
