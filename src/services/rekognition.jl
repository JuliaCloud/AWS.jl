    CompareFaces()

Compares a face in the source input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the target input image.    If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.   You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.  In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.   By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the SimilarityThreshold parameter.   CompareFaces also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use QualityFilter to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE. The default value is NONE.   To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection.   If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, CompareFaces returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation. If no faces are detected in the source or target images, CompareFaces returns an InvalidParameterException error.    This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.  For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CompareFaces action.

Required Parameters

Optional Parameters
{
  "QualityFilter": "A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to identify faces. Filtered faces aren't compared. If you specify AUTO, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, filtering removes all faces that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify NONE, no filtering is performed. The default value is NONE.  To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.",

    DetectCustomLabels()

Detects custom labels in a supplied image by using an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model.  You specify which version of a model version to use by using the ProjectVersionArn input parameter.  You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a (CustomLabel) object in an array (CustomLabels). Each CustomLabel object provides the label name (Name), the level of confidence that the image contains the object (Confidence), and object location information, if it exists, for the label on the image (Geometry).  During training model calculates a threshold value that determines if a prediction for a label is true. By default, DetectCustomLabels doesn't return labels whose confidence value is below the model's calculated threshold value. To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for MinConfidence that is higher than the model's calculated threshold. You can get the model's calculated threshold from the model's training results shown in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console. To get all labels, regardless of confidence, specify a MinConfidence value of 0.  You can also add the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned.  This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectCustomLabels action.

"""
    DetectFaces()

Detects faces within an image that is provided as input.  DetectFaces detects the 100 largest faces in the image. For each face detected, the operation returns face details. These details include a bounding box of the face, a confidence value (that the bounding box contains a face), and a fixed set of attributes such as facial landmarks (for example, coordinates of eye and mouth), presence of beard, sunglasses, and so on.  The face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured faces, the algorithm might not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower confidence.  You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.  This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectFaces action. 

Required Parameters

"""
DetectFaces(args) = rekognition("DetectFaces", args)

"""
    DetectLabels()

Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature.  For an example, see Analyzing Images Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.   DetectLabels does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see StartLabelDetection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.  You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.   {Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}   {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}    {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}  In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.   {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}  In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip. In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the MaxLabels parameter to limit the number of labels returned.   If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the DetectFaces operation provides.   DetectLabels returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.  DetectLabels also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.  This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectLabels action. 

Required Parameters
{
  "Image": "The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported.

"""
    DetectModerationLabels()

Detects unsafe content in a specified JPEG or PNG format image. Use DetectModerationLabels to moderate images depending on your requirements. For example, you might want to filter images that contain nudity, but not images containing suggestive content. To filter images, use the labels returned by DetectModerationLabels to determine which types of content are appropriate. For information about moderation labels, see Detecting Unsafe Content in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket.

"""
    DetectText()

Detects text in the input image and converts it into machine-readable text. Pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, you must pass it as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. For the AWS CLI, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file.  The DetectText operation returns text in an array of TextDetection elements, TextDetections. Each TextDetection element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image.  A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated by spaces. DetectText can detect up to 50 words in an image. A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the DetectText operation returns multiple lines. To determine whether a TextDetection element is a line of text or a word, use the TextDetection object Type field.  To be detected, text must be within +/- 90 degrees orientation of the horizontal axis. For more information, see DetectText in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

Required Parameters

    GetFaceSearch()

Gets the face search results for Amazon Rekognition Video face search started by StartFaceSearch. The search returns faces in a collection that match the faces of persons detected in a video. It also includes the time(s) that faces are matched in the video. Face search in a video is an asynchronous operation. You start face search by calling to StartFaceSearch which returns a job identifier (JobId). When the search operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to StartFaceSearch. To get the search results, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetFaceSearch and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartFaceSearch. For more information, see Searching Faces in a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. The search results are retured in an array, Persons, of PersonMatch objects. EachPersonMatch element contains details about the matching faces in the input collection, person information (facial attributes, bounding boxes, and person identifer) for the matched person, and the time the person was matched in the video.   GetFaceSearch only returns the default facial attributes (BoundingBox, Confidence, Landmarks, Pose, and Quality). The other facial attributes listed in the Face object of the following response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

    IndexFaces()

Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.  Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the SearchFaces and SearchFacesByImage operations. For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. To get the number of faces in a collection, call DescribeCollection.  If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, IndexFaces indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.  If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the OrientationCorrection field.  To determine which version of the model you're using, call DescribeCollection and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of FaceModelVersion in the response from IndexFaces  For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. If you provide the optional ExternalImageID for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the ListFaces operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image. You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the MaxFaces input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, IndexFaces chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use QualityFilter, to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE.   To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection.   Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of UnindexedFace objects, UnindexedFaces. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as:   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the MaxFaces request parameter.   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.   The face is too blurry.   The image is too dark.   The face has an extreme pose.   The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.   In response, the IndexFaces operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, FaceRecords. This includes:    The bounding box, BoundingBox, of the detected face.    A confidence value, Confidence, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.   A face ID, FaceId, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.   An image ID, ImageId, assigned by the service for the input image.   If you request all facial attributes (by using the detectionAttributes parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the IndexFaces operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata.  The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.  This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:IndexFaces action.

Required Parameters
{
  "CollectionId": "The ID of an existing collection to which you want to add the faces that are detected in the input images.",
  "Image": "The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes isn't supported.  If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the Bytes field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "DetectionAttributes": "An array of facial attributes that you want to be returned. This can be the default list of attributes or all attributes. If you don't specify a value for Attributes or if you specify [\"DEFAULT\"], the API returns the following subset of facial attributes: BoundingBox, Confidence, Pose, Quality, and Landmarks. If you provide [\"ALL\"], all facial attributes are returned, but the operation takes longer to complete. If you provide both, [\"ALL\", \"DEFAULT\"], the service uses a logical AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes). ",
  "ExternalImageId": "The ID you want to assign to all the faces detected in the image.",
  "MaxFaces": "The maximum number of faces to index. The value of MaxFaces must be greater than or equal to 1. IndexFaces returns no more than 100 detected faces in an image, even if you specify a larger value for MaxFaces. If IndexFaces detects more faces than the value of MaxFaces, the faces with the lowest quality are filtered out first. If there are still more faces than the value of MaxFaces, the faces with the smallest bounding boxes are filtered out (up to the number that's needed to satisfy the value of MaxFaces). Information about the unindexed faces is available in the UnindexedFaces array.  The faces that are returned by IndexFaces are sorted by the largest face bounding box size to the smallest size, in descending order.  MaxFaces can be used with a collection associated with any version of the face model.",
  "QualityFilter": "A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to identify faces. Filtered faces aren't indexed. If you specify AUTO, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, filtering removes all faces that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The default value is AUTO. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify NONE, no filtering is performed.  To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher."

    StartLabelDetection()

Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video. Amazon Rekognition Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are instances of real-world entities. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; concepts like landscape, evening, and nature; and activities like a person getting out of a car or a person skiing. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. StartLabelDetection returns a job identifier (JobId) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel. To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartLabelDetection. 

Required Parameters
{
  "Video": "The video in which you want to detect labels. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "ClientRequestToken": "Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use the same token with multiple StartLabelDetection requests, the same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from being accidently started more than once. ",
  "JobTag": "An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notification that's published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service topic. For example, you can use JobTag to group related jobs and identify them in the completion notification.",
  "MinConfidence": "Specifies the minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition Video must have in order to return a detected label. Confidence represents how certain Amazon Rekognition is that a label is correctly identified.0 is the lowest confidence. 100 is the highest confidence. Amazon Rekognition Video doesn't return any labels with a confidence level lower than this specified value. If you don't specify MinConfidence, the operation returns labels with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.",
  "NotificationChannel": "The Amazon SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video to publish the completion status of the label detection operation to. "

    StartPersonTracking()

Starts the asynchronous tracking of a person's path in a stored video. Amazon Rekognition Video can track the path of people in a video stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. StartPersonTracking returns a job identifier (JobId) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel.  To get the results of the person detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED.

    StartProjectVersion()

Starts the running of the version of a model. Starting a model takes a while to complete. To check the current state of the model, use DescribeProjectVersions. Once the model is running, you can detect custom labels in new images by calling DetectCustomLabels.  You are charged for the amount of time that the model is running. To stop a running model, call StopProjectVersion.  This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:StartProjectVersion action.

Required Parameters
