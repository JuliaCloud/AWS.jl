    TagStream()

Adds one or more tags to a stream. A tag is a key-value pair (the value is optional) that you can define and assign to AWS resources. If you specify a tag that already exists, the tag value is replaced with the value that you specify in the request. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.  You must provide either the StreamName or the StreamARN. This operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:TagStream action. Kinesis video streams support up to 50 tags.

    CreateStream()

Creates a new Kinesis video stream.  When you create a new stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns it a version number. When you change the stream's metadata, Kinesis Video Streams updates the version.   CreateStream is an asynchronous operation. For information about how the service works, see How it Works.  You must have permissions for the KinesisVideo:CreateStream action.

Required Parameters
{
  "StreamName": "A name for the stream that you are creating. The stream name is an identifier for the stream, and must be unique for each account and region."
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "Tags": "A list of tags to associate with the specified stream. Each tag is a key-value pair (the value is optional).",

  "DataRetentionInHours": "The number of hours that you want to retain the data in the stream. Kinesis Video Streams retains the data in a data store that is associated with the stream. The default value is 0, indicating that the stream does not persist data. When the DataRetentionInHours value is 0, consumers can still consume the fragments that remain in the service host buffer, which has a retention time limit of 5 minutes and a retention memory limit of 200 MB. Fragments are removed from the buffer when either limit is reached."

"""
    DeleteStream()

Deletes a Kinesis video stream and the data contained in the stream.  This method marks the stream for deletion, and makes the data in the stream inaccessible immediately.    To ensure that you have the latest version of the stream before deleting it, you can specify the stream version. Kinesis Video Streams assigns a version to each stream. When you update a stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns a new version number. To get the latest stream version, use the DescribeStream API.  This operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:DeleteStream action.

Required Parameters
{
  "StreamARN": "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream that you want to delete. "
}

Optional Parameters
{
  "CurrentVersion": "Optional: The version of the stream that you want to delete.  Specify the version as a safeguard to ensure that your are deleting the correct stream.

"""
    UpdateDataRetention()

 Increases or decreases the stream's data retention period by the value that you specify. To indicate whether you want to increase or decrease the data retention period, specify the Operation parameter in the request body. In the request, you must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN.   The retention period that you specify replaces the current value.  This operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:UpdateDataRetention action. Changing the data retention period affects the data in the stream as follows:   If the data retention period is increased, existing data is retained for the new retention period. For example, if the data retention period is increased from one hour to seven hours, all existing data is retained for seven hours.   If the data retention period is decreased, existing data is retained for the new retention period. For example, if the data retention period is decreased from seven hours to one hour, all existing data is retained for one hour, and any data older than one hour is deleted immediately.  

Required Parameters
{
  "Operation": "Indicates whether you want to increase or decrease the retention period.",
  "DataRetentionChangeInHours": "The retention period, in hours. The value you specify replaces the current value. The maximum value for this parameter is 87600 (ten years).",

    GetSignalingChannelEndpoint()

Provides an endpoint for the specified signaling channel to send and receive messages. This API uses the SingleMasterChannelEndpointConfiguration input parameter, which consists of the Protocols and Role properties.  Protocols is used to determine the communication mechanism. For example, specifying WSS as the protocol, results in this API producing a secure websocket endpoint, and specifying HTTPS as the protocol, results in this API generating an HTTPS endpoint.   Role determines the messaging permissions. A MASTER role results in this API generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate with any of the viewers on the channel. A VIEWER role results in this API generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate only with a MASTER.
