Cancel a zonal shift in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. To cancel the
zonal shift, specify the zonal shift ID. A zonal shift can be one that you've started for a
resource in your Amazon Web Services account in an Amazon Web Services Region, or it can be
a zonal shift started by a practice run with zonal autoshift.

    create_practice_run_configuration(outcome_alarms, resource_identifier)
    create_practice_run_configuration(outcome_alarms, resource_identifier, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

A practice run configuration for zonal autoshift is required when you enable zonal
autoshift. A practice run configuration includes specifications for blocked dates and
blocked time windows, and for Amazon CloudWatch alarms that you create to use with practice
runs. The alarms that you specify are an outcome alarm, to monitor application health
during practice runs and, optionally, a blocking alarm, to block practice runs from
starting. For more information, see  Considerations when you configure zonal autoshift in
the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `outcome_alarms`: The outcome alarm for practice runs is a required Amazon CloudWatch
  alarm that you specify that ends a practice run when the alarm is in an ALARM state.
  Configure the alarm to monitor the health of your application when traffic is shifted away
  from an Availability Zone during each weekly practice run. You should configure the alarm
  to go into an ALARM state if your application is impacted by the zonal shift, and you want
  to stop the zonal shift, to let traffic for the resource return to the Availability Zone.
- `resource_identifier`: The identifier of the resource to shift away traffic for when a
  practice run starts a zonal shift. The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
  resource. At this time, supported resources are Network Load Balancers and Application Load
  Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"blockedDates"`: Optionally, you can block Route 53 ARC from starting practice runs for
  a resource on specific calendar dates. The format for blocked dates is: YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in
  mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Separate
  multiple blocked dates with spaces. For example, if you have an application update
  scheduled to launch on May 1, 2024, and you don't want practice runs to shift traffic away
  at that time, you could set a blocked date for 2024-05-01.
- `"blockedWindows"`: Optionally, you can block Route 53 ARC from starting practice runs
  for specific windows of days and times.  The format for blocked windows is:
  DAY:HH:SS-DAY:HH:SS. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for
  practice runs are in UTC. Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might be
  required for daylight saving time differences. Separate multiple blocked windows with
  spaces. For example, say you run business report summaries three days a week. For this
  scenario, you might set the following recurring days and times as blocked windows, for
  example: MON-20:30-21:30 WED-20:30-21:30 FRI-20:30-21:30.
- `"blockingAlarms"`: An Amazon CloudWatch alarm that you can specify for zonal autoshift
  practice runs. This alarm blocks Route 53 ARC from starting practice run zonal shifts, and
  ends a practice run that's in progress, when the alarm is in an ALARM state.

    start_zonal_shift(away_from, comment, expires_in, resource_identifier)
    start_zonal_shift(away_from, comment, expires_in, resource_identifier, params::Dict{String,<:Any})

You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic away from an Availability
Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region, to help your application recover immediately, for
example, from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services
infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone. You can start a zonal shift in Route
53 ARC only for managed resources in your Amazon Web Services account in an Amazon Web
Services Region. Resources are automatically registered with Route 53 ARC by Amazon Web
Services services. At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load
Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off. When
you start a zonal shift, traffic for the resource is no longer routed to the Availability
Zone. The zonal shift is created immediately in Route 53 ARC. However, it can take a short
time, typically up to a few minutes, for existing, in-progress connections in the
Availability Zone to complete. For more information, see Zonal shift in the Amazon Route 53
Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

# Arguments
- `away_from`: The Availability Zone that traffic is moved away from for a resource when
  you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift expires or you cancel it, traffic for the
  resource is instead moved to other Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.
- `comment`: A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest comment is
  retained; no comment history is maintained. A new comment overwrites any existing comment
  string.
- `expires_in`: The length of time that you want a zonal shift to be active, which Route 53
  ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration time). Zonal shifts are temporary. You can set a
  zonal shift to be active initially for up to three days (72 hours). If you want to still
  keep traffic away from an Availability Zone, you can update the zonal shift and set a new
  expiration. You can also cancel a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're
  ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone. To set a length of time for a zonal
  shift to be active, specify a whole number, and then one of the following, with no space:
   A lowercase letter m: To specify that the value is in minutes.    A lowercase letter h: To
  specify that the value is in hours.   For example: 20h means the zonal shift expires in 20
  hours. 120m means the zonal shift expires in 120 minutes (2 hours).
- `resource_identifier`: The identifier for the resource to shift away traffic for. The
  identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource. At this time, supported
  resources are Network Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load
  balancing turned off.
