- `name`: A unique name for the fleet.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"Description"`: The description to display.
- `"DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds"`: The amount of time that a streaming session remains
  active after users disconnect. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session after a
  disconnection or network interruption within this time interval, they are connected to
  their previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to a new session with a new streaming
  instance.  Specify a value between 60 and 360000.
- `"DisplayName"`: The fleet name to display.
- `"DomainJoinInfo"`: The name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use to join
  the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.
- `"EnableDefaultInternetAccess"`: Enables or disables default internet access for the
  fleet.
- `"FleetType"`: The fleet type.  ALWAYS_ON  Provides users with instant-on access to their
  apps. You are charged for all running instances in your fleet, even if no users are
  streaming apps.  ON_DEMAND  Provide users with access to applications after they connect,
  which takes one to two minutes. You are charged for instance streaming when users are
  connected and a small hourly fee for instances that are not streaming apps.
- `"IamRoleArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to apply to the fleet. To
  assume a role, a fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token Service (STS) AssumeRole API
  operation and passes the ARN of the role to use. The operation creates a new session with
  temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and creates the
  appstream_machine_role credential profile on the instance. For more information, see Using
  an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0
  Streaming Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide.
- `"IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds"`: The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive)
  before they are disconnected from their streaming session and the
  DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds time interval begins. Users are notified before they are
  disconnected due to inactivity. If they try to reconnect to the streaming session before
  the time interval specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to
  their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or
  mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio
  out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle
  after the time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.
  To prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0.
  Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 3600. The default value is 0.  If you enable this
  feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number
  of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't do this, the value is rounded to
  the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after
  1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two
  different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90,
  users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity.
- `"ImageArn"`: The ARN of the public, private, or shared image to use.
- `"ImageName"`: The name of the image used to create the fleet.
- `"MaxUserDurationInSeconds"`: The maximum amount of time that a streaming session can
  remain active, in seconds. If users are still connected to a streaming instance five
  minutes before this limit is reached, they are prompted to save any open documents before
  being disconnected. After this time elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced by a
  new instance. Specify a value between 600 and 360000.
- `"StreamView"`: The AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your users when they stream
  from the fleet. When APP is specified, only the windows of applications opened by users
  display. When DESKTOP is specified, the standard desktop that is provided by the operating
  system displays. The default value is APP.
- `"Tags"`: The tags to associate with the fleet. A tag is a key-value pair, and the value
  is optional. For example, Environment=Test. If you do not specify a value, Environment=.
  If you do not specify a value, the value is set to an empty string. Generally allowed
  characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
  special characters:  _ . : / = +  - @ For more information, see Tagging Your Resources in
  the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide.
- `"VpcConfig"`: The VPC configuration for the fleet.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a `params::Dict{String,<:Any}`. Valid keys are:
- `"AttributesToDelete"`: The fleet attributes to delete.
- `"ComputeCapacity"`: The desired capacity for the fleet.
- `"DeleteVpcConfig"`: Deletes the VPC association for the specified fleet.
- `"Description"`: The description to display.
- `"DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds"`: The amount of time that a streaming session remains
  active after users disconnect. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session after a
  disconnection or network interruption within this time interval, they are connected to
  their previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to a new session with a new streaming
  instance.  Specify a value between 60 and 360000.
- `"DisplayName"`: The fleet name to display.
- `"DomainJoinInfo"`: The name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use to join
  the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.
- `"EnableDefaultInternetAccess"`: Enables or disables default internet access for the
  fleet.
- `"IamRoleArn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to apply to the fleet. To
  assume a role, a fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token Service (STS) AssumeRole API
  operation and passes the ARN of the role to use. The operation creates a new session with
  temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and creates the
  appstream_machine_role credential profile on the instance. For more information, see Using
  an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0
  Streaming Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide.
- `"IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds"`: The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive)
  before they are disconnected from their streaming session and the
  DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds time interval begins. Users are notified before they are
  disconnected due to inactivity. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session before
  the time interval specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to
  their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or
  mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio
  out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle
  after the time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.
  To prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0.
  Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 3600. The default value is 0.  If you enable this
  feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number
  of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't do this, the value is rounded to
  the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after
  1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two
  different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90,
  users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity.
- `"ImageArn"`: The ARN of the public, private, or shared image to use.
- `"ImageName"`: The name of the image used to create the fleet.
- `"InstanceType"`: The instance type to use when launching fleet instances. The following
  instance types are available:   stream.standard.small   stream.standard.medium
  stream.standard.large   stream.compute.large   stream.compute.xlarge
  stream.compute.2xlarge   stream.compute.4xlarge   stream.compute.8xlarge

- `"MaxUserDurationInSeconds"`: The maximum amount of time that a streaming session can
  remain active, in seconds. If users are still connected to a streaming instance five
  minutes before this limit is reached, they are prompted to save any open documents before
  being disconnected. After this time elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced by a
  new instance. Specify a value between 600 and 360000.
- `"Name"`: A unique name for the fleet.
- `"StreamView"`: The AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your users when they stream
  from the fleet. When APP is specified, only the windows of applications opened by users
  display. When DESKTOP is specified, the standard desktop that is provided by the operating
  system displays. The default value is APP.
- `"VpcConfig"`: The VPC configuration for the fleet.
