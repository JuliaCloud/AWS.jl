    AddApplicationCloudWatchLoggingOption()

Adds an Amazon CloudWatch log stream to monitor application configuration errors.

Required Parameters
{
  "ApplicationName": "The Kinesis Data Analytics application name.",
  "CloudWatchLoggingOption": "Provides the Amazon CloudWatch log stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ",
  "CurrentApplicationVersionId": "The version ID of the Kinesis Data Analytics application. You can retrieve the application version ID using DescribeApplication."

    AddApplicationInput()

 Adds a streaming source to your SQL-based Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application.  You can add a streaming source when you create an application, or you can use this operation to add a streaming source after you create an application. For more information, see CreateApplication. Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to find the current application version. 

Required Parameters
{
  "ApplicationName": "The name of your existing application to which you want to add the streaming source.",
  "CurrentApplicationVersionId": "The current version of your application. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to find the current application version.",

    AddApplicationInputProcessingConfiguration()

Adds an InputProcessingConfiguration to an SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics application. An input processor pre-processes records on the input stream before the application's SQL code executes. Currently, the only input processor available is AWS Lambda.

Required Parameters
{
  "ApplicationName": "The name of the application to which you want to add the input processing configuration.",
  "CurrentApplicationVersionId": "The version of the application to which you want to add the input processing configuration. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to get the current application version. If the version specified is not the current version, the ConcurrentModificationException is returned.",

    AddApplicationOutput()

Adds an external destination to your SQL-based Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application. If you want Kinesis Data Analytics to deliver data from an in-application stream within your application to an external destination (such as an Kinesis data stream, a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, or an AWS Lambda function), you add the relevant configuration to your application using this operation. You can configure one or more outputs for your application. Each output configuration maps an in-application stream and an external destination.  You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your in-application error stream to an external destination so that you can analyze the errors.   Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to find the current application version.

Required Parameters
{
  "ApplicationName": "The name of the application to which you want to add the output configuration.",
  "CurrentApplicationVersionId": "The version of the application to which you want to add the output configuration. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to get the current application version. If the version specified is not the current version, the ConcurrentModificationException is returned. ",
  "Output": "An array of objects, each describing one output configuration. In the output configuration, you specify the name of an in-application stream, a destination (that is, a Kinesis data stream, a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, or an AWS Lambda function), and record the formation to use when writing to the destination."

    AddApplicationVpcConfiguration()

Adds a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration to the application. Applications can use VPCs to store and access resources securely.
