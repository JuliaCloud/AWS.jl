If no arguments are provided, the version defaults to Python 2.
NumberOfNodes => The number of AWS Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) to allocate to this DevEndpoint.
NumberOfWorkers => The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated to the development endpoint. The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X, and 149 for G.2X. 
PublicKey => The public key to be used by this DevEndpoint for authentication. This attribute is provided for backward compatibility because the recommended attribute to use is public keys.
PublicKeys => A list of public keys to be used by the development endpoints for authentication. The use of this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.  If you previously created an endpoint with a public key, you must remove that key to be able to set a list of public keys. Call the UpdateDevEndpoint API with the public key content in the deletePublicKeys attribute, and the list of new keys in the addPublicKeys attribute.

"""
    StartImportLabelsTaskRun()

Enables you to provide additional labels (examples of truth) to be used to teach the machine learning transform and improve its quality. This API operation is generally used as part of the active learning workflow that starts with the StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun call and that ultimately results in improving the quality of your machine learning transform.  After the StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun finishes, AWS Glue machine learning will have generated a series of questions for humans to answer. (Answering these questions is often called 'labeling' in the machine learning workflows). In the case of the FindMatches transform, these questions are of the form, “What is the correct way to group these rows together into groups composed entirely of matching records?” After the labeling process is finished, users upload their answers/labels with a call to StartImportLabelsTaskRun. After StartImportLabelsTaskRun finishes, all future runs of the machine learning transform use the new and improved labels and perform a higher-quality transformation. By default, StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun continually learns from and combines all labels that you upload unless you set Replace to true. If you set Replace to true, StartImportLabelsTaskRun deletes and forgets all previously uploaded labels and learns only from the exact set that you upload. Replacing labels can be helpful if you realize that you previously uploaded incorrect labels, and you believe that they are having a negative effect on your transform quality. You can check on the status of your task run by calling the GetMLTaskRun operation.

Optional Parameters
AllocatedCapacity => This field is deprecated. Use MaxCapacity instead. The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) to allocate to this JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the AWS Glue pricing page.
Arguments => The job arguments specifically for this run. For this job run, they replace the default arguments set in the job definition itself. You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes. For information about how to specify and consume your own Job arguments, see the Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python topic in the developer guide. For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see the Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue topic in the developer guide.
JobRunId => The ID of a previous JobRun to retry.
MaxCapacity => The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the AWS Glue pricing page. Do not set Max Capacity if using WorkerType and NumberOfWorkers. The value that can be allocated for MaxCapacity depends on whether you are running a Python shell job, or an Apache Spark ETL job:   When you specify a Python shell job (JobCommand.Name="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.   When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job (JobCommand.Name="glueetl"), you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.  
NotificationProperty => Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.
NumberOfWorkers => The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated when a job runs. The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X, and 149 for G.2X. 
SecurityConfiguration => The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this job run.
Timeout => The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters TIMEOUT status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.
WorkerType => The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.   For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.   For the G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
